The flyer, who suspects the hand of airport employees, said he had to wait for almost five hours in Mumbai to lodge a police complaint.Binod Kumar Mandal (46) said after landing at the domestic terminal, he found his bag's number lock and the zip had been tampered with. On a 2-day official trip, he said he had carried the cash for emergency. ""The fountain pen, valued at Rs 5,000, was a family heirloom...a gift from my grandfather who had bought it in 1946.""He said despite thefts being rampant on flights, few approach police or the airline concerned ""as these authorities test the patience of people already in shock"".B inod Kumar Mandal, who is director with a Manipal Group firm, lost Rs 1 lakh in cash and a Rs 5,000 fountain pen from his checked-in bag while flying from Mangaluru to Mumbai on Wednesday. He said he had kept the cash in the bag thinking it cannot be stolen . Besides, he said “there is always a possibility of a pickpocket or snatching when you enter a new city”.“I am from Kolkata but have been working in Mangaluru with Manipal Tech Group Companies,” he told TOI. He said authorities test the patients of people who go to them with such complaints “instead of solving their problems”. “In my case, I had the proof of money that I had withdrawn from the bank that I carried with me,” he said.Mandal said this is the first time he has experienced baggage theft although he is a frequent flyer. “It is a handin-glove act by people inside the airport, otherwise the theft would not have occurred. I suspect that the person who does the baggage scanning would have tipped off the loader who would have stolen the cash at a place where there is no CCTV coverage,” he said. Police have registered a case of theft against an unknown person.","MUMBAI: In a case of theft from a checked-in bag , a director with a Manipal Group company lost Rs 1 lakh in cash and a 78-year-old fountain pen while flying from Mangaluru to Mumbai Wednesday.

3,"Stock market today: BSE Sensex closes over 840 points up, Nifty50 nears 21,900","Stock market today : Indian benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , witnessed a significant surge on Friday, with the Sensex rallying over 900 points and the Nifty breaking its previous all-time high. The 50-share pack index reached a peak of over 21,928, led by gains in heavyweights TCS and Infosys.BSE Sensex closed the trading day at 72,568.45, up 847 points or 1.18%.Nifty50 too was up 1.14% or 247 points at 21,894.55. While BSE Sensex hit an intraday high of 72,720.96, Nifty50 saw a high of 21,928.In dollar terms, the Indian stock market is now valued at around $4.49 trillion, positioning itself to potentially surpass Hong Kong as the world's fourth-largest hub of equities, according to an ET report.The Nifty IT sector emerged as the top gainer, surging by about 5%, with Infosys gaining around 8% and Coforge by 5%. Other IT stocks such as Tech Mahindra, Wipro, TCS, Mphasis, and LTIMindtree also experienced gains of about 4% each. The market rally was primarily triggered by the strong buying interest in IT stocks following the inline results of Infosys and the positive surprise from TCS. Experts predict that the recent quarters' strong deal wins will gradually translate into revenue in the coming quarters, further strengthening the sector.The sustainability of this rally will depend on the ongoing December quarter earnings season, which is expected to be a crucial factor driving market returns in the near term. The recent substantial increase in the shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) has also provided support to the index. Additionally, market participants will closely monitor the HDFC Bank results on January 16th for insights into the direction of Bank Nifty.V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services stated that the resilience in IT stocks and strength in Reliance will enable Nifty to consolidate around 21,600 levels. HDFC Bank results on January 16th will be keenly watched by the market for cues in the direction of Bank Nifty.The US Department of Labor's consumer price index (CPI), a crucial indicator of inflation, showed a 3.4% increase compared to the previous year, surpassing November's figure.While the US market remained relatively unchanged due to higher-than-expected inflation, Japan's Nikkei share average reached a new 34-year peak on Friday, influencing positive sentiments in the Indian market.The US CPI inflation inching up to 3.4% YoY is slightly negative from the global equity market perspective. The rate cut expected from the US Fed in March this year may not materialize. It is likely to be postponed to June, and therefore, rate cuts by the MPC will also get delayed, said Vijayakumar.Wall Street equities closed with little change after data revealed that headline CPI rose above estimates at 0.3% in December, resulting in an annual gain of 3.4%.","Stock market today : Indian benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , witnessed a significant surge on Friday, with the Sensex rallying over 900 points and the Nifty breaking its previous all-time high.

4,'MS Dhoni has given me two-three...': Shivam Dube explains the secret behind his transformation,"Wisden picks 2023 men’s ODI team of the year, includes 7 Indians in the XI

NEW DELHI: Marking a dynamic comeback to the Indian team, Shivam Dube played a pivotal role with a powerful 60 not out off 40 balls in the first T20I against Afghanistan. He attributed the positive shift in his attitude and approach to the iconic MS Dhoni , whose influence has been instrumental in Dube's cricketing journey.Dube's impactful half-century significantly contributed to India's comfortable six-wicket victory on Thursday, earning him the well-deserved Player of the Match award.""When I came to bat, I wanted to implement what I have learnt from MS Dhoni about finishing games. I keep speaking to Mahi bhai. He tells me about how to tackle different situations. He has given me two-three tips and rated my batting.""So, I feel if he rates my batting then I'll keep playing well. My confidence went up because of that,"" Dube told 'JIO Cinema'.Dube's previous appearance for India was in last year's Asian Games at Hangzhou.The Mumbai player was part of the India squad for home T20I series against Australia but did not get a chance to play and was not selected for the away series against South Africa.Dube also found shades of Dhoni in the wayRohit Sharma captained the side, and allowed him the space to perform.""Both allow me to bat higher in the order. There's a lot of work to be done and I know they will back me and want me to do well. So, that makes me feel a lot more positive,"" he added.Dube also grabbed the important wicket of Afghan captain Ibrahim Zadran (25 off 22 balls), and the pacer said he has been working on his bowling.""The changes have not come suddenly. In the off-season, I worked a lot on my fitness. After that, I bowled a lot in domestic cricket too so things kept improving.""I was able to find the right areas and also generate a decent pace,"" he said.","""When I came to bat, I wanted to implement what I have learnt from MS Dhoni about finishing games.

6,It is time for the US to go back to Afghanistan,"It is time for the US to go back to Afghanistan

Kathy Gannon

New York Times Jan 5, 2024, 11:53 IST IST

The US needs to realise that not all Afghans support the relentless restrictions on girls and women. It needs to facilitate a way forward and for that it needs to come down to the war-torn country

It’s striking how much Afghanistan , which has the unfortunate legacy of being the site of America’s longest war, has all but disappeared from public discussion in the United States. But perhaps it’s understandable. After all, there always seems to be another conflict, another war — which, as it happens, is also Afghanistan’s history.

Since 1979, Afghans have lived in almost perpetual conflict. Millions of people have been forced to flee their homes or their country. Foreign interventions have come and gone, ending in failure, leaving Afghans and their neighbours to live with the consequences.","It needs to facilitate a way forward and for that it needs to come down to the war-torn countryIt’s striking how much Afghanistan , which has the unfortunate legacy of being the site of America’s longest war, has all but disappeared from public discussion in the United States.

7,'Both Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi have elevated the writing with their performances in Merry Christmas' - Sriram Raghavan- Exclusive!,"One of the best

filmmakers

in the neo-noir thriller genre, Sriram Raghavan's

Merry Christmas

has hit screens today. Starring

Katrina Kaif

and Vijay Sethupathi in lead roles, the bilingual movie has been grabbing eyeballs ever since its trailer dropped. In a quick chat with ETimes, the director, known for movies like 'Ek Hasina Thi' and 'Andhadhun', takes us through his latest offering, his filmmaking challenges and more...

What made you decide to make Merry Christmas?

Did the title Merry Christmas evolve over time?

Were Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi the original choices? If yes, why did you want them for their respective roles?

Did Katrina and Vijay surprise you as actors in any way?

In what ways are the Hindi and Tamil versions of the film different from each other?

Do you think the Christmas week of 2023 was a better window for the release?

What kind of battles do you still have to fight to make the cinema of your choice?

Merry Christmas First Day First Show Public Review: Katrina Kaif, Vijay Sethupathi, Sriram Raghavan

After Merry Christmas, what are you going to make next?

How was it working with Dharmendra in Ikkis?

How do you look at your journey in cinema so far?

It's been 20 years since you made your first feature. Do you think you could have directed more films?

Is there a film that you have been wanting to make, but haven't got the chance to make it?

The way films are made (the show and the biz part of it), what is something that you've made peace with, considering you've had to fight to make the kind of cinema you want ?

How is Katrina as an actor? The general impression is that she is a huge star, but as an actor she still needs a role that challenges her..

In 2004, when Ram Gopal Varma watched the final cut of Ek Hasina Thi, he told me, 'you have made a good film.Now don’t try to repeat it. You should do something completely different.' That stuck with me... Andhadhun was a big success with the audiences and critics. I was very clear that I do not want to follow that template for success. I had the story of Merry Christmas for a few years, and felt it was a good time to do it. Since the earlier film was a success, I felt encouraged to take some fresh risks.Oh yes, I had a couple of Hindi titles based on some of my favourite songs. Some options I remember are Raat akeli Hai, Raat ke Hamsafar, Baat ek raat ki and so on. Then came Honey Trehan’s Raat akeli hai and I felt any title with raat would give a similar vibe. It was Dinesh Vijan who suggested MERRY CHRISTMAS as a title. It was simple, and yet perfect in the context of our story.I wanted the story to have a dream-like quality. In my mind, I tried various conventional pairings, but some X factor seemed to be missing. Most of the stars had already worked with each other. Since the story is about two strangers meeting on Christmas eve, I wanted an out of the box pairing. Katrina is a glamorous star and Vijay is known for his rooted characters. The opposites attracted me.Definitely. It was the first time I was working with either of them. I can happily say that they enhanced the writing with their performances. I mean, how do you write chemistry in a script? That was purely on them.It is the same source material but the two languages have different idioms, and there are subtle differences in both versions.Definitely. We had announced our release in December, but then I saw that the month was packed with big releases, and we didn’t want to get caught in the blood bath. We would also not get our choice of cinemas, hence we pushed the dates.The usual battles. Casting choices, budgets, trailer cutting, marketing ideas and more. Most important is the battle within the mind, regarding how best to tell the story in a cinematic manner.I have already commenced shooting of IKKIS, based on the story of Arun Khetarpal, the young tank commander who was martyred whilst defending a crucial sector in the 1971 war. It stars Dharmendra and Jaideep Ahlawat, along with Agastya Nanda, who plays the war hero. We have completed an important section of the film. We will resume shooting from February this year.Dharamji is a treat to work with. As an actor, he is hungrier and more hard working than many younger actors today. Everyone loves him on the sets. I thoroughly enjoy talking to him about some of the great films and directors he has worked with in his illustrious career.I have been lucky with my actors and even though every film wasn’t a huge hit, we never lost money, and managed to make our kind of cinema.Well…definitely, but for various reasons it didn’t happen. Ridley Scott and Woody Allen would have made twenty films in this period!Luckily, I have not had a dearth of producers who are willing to back me. I have various ideas, treatments which are half done, or half baked, so it is always a work in progress.I don’t enjoy promotions, but I know it needs to be done, simply to spread awareness about the film. My films mostly rely on word of mouth publicity. And hopefully, good reviews by esteemed critics.Please watch MERRY CHRISTMAS and you will get your answer...","Did the title Merry Christmas evolve over time?

8,Why it is important to have pet festivals,"Pet Fed is like a

carnival for pets

and pet lovers, with many activities and workshops.

What inspired you to create this event for our furry friends and their owners?

Why do you think there is a need for more festivals like this?



How do you think the festival contributes to strengthening the bond between pets and the owners?



Tell us about some pets that remain etched in your memory?



What are the challenges that you initially faced while organising the festival?



What's your personal favorite activity or workshop that you believe every pet parent should experience at least once?

The connection we share with our pets is a special and cherished relationship that brings joy, companionship, and a unique form of love into our lives. It goes beyond a mere companionship; it's a bond that enriches our daily experiences. Akshay Gupta, Founder of Pet Fed, talks in detail about why it is important to have pet festivals and how celebrating your furry friends can go a long way in changing the way we look at them.I started Pet Fed back in 2014 when I realized that there is an event for every liking of a human being in the country whether it is food, fashion, art, music but there was not anything for people who had pets and pets themselves. For every other thing there is a community of people that you can engage, interact and learn with but there was not anything from pet parents so we thought that we will create something of that sort. Pets and pet parents can come together at a common platform and learn from each other and see what is there in the category for better pet parenting.I think we need to have and encourage more festivals like this so that we can promote pet welfare, strengthen the bond between pets and their owners, and build a sense of community among pet enthusiasts. Main focus is to highlight the importance of Adopting the Pet instead of buying and selling them. We always follow our motto #AdoptDontShop and we want our audience to follow this motto. As you know, selling and buying is not good and appropriate, but adoption allows us to freely choose the pet we want without comparing and buying. It provides shelter for the needy. Pet welfare includes the well-being, health, and humane treatment of animals kept as pets. Ensuring good pet welfare involves meeting their physical, behavioral, and emotional needs.The bond between pet and the owners has to be understanding which requires attention and patience to deal with.Organizing events like this can contribute to raising awareness about responsible pet ownership, providing a space for pet-related businesses to showcase their products and services, and fostering a positive environment for pets and their owners to socialize. Pet festivals like Pet Fed play a crucial role in fortifying the bond between pets and their owners. By offering a plethora of shared experiences, from engaging in various activities to participating in workshops, these events create everlasting memories that deepen the emotional connection.The socialization opportunities provided in festival settings help pets become more accustomed to diverse environments and foster positive behavior in social settings. Fun and play activities, alongside pet-friendly services, contribute to the enjoyment and well-being of pets, reinforcing positive associations with the festival experience. Additionally, participating in training sessions and bonding activities encourages effective communication and teamwork between pets and their owners. The sense of community fostered by pet festivals, where owners share stories and tips, further strengthens the support network and a feeling of belonging. Through talent showcases and celebrations dedicated to the unique bond, these festivals become a joyous ode to the special relationship between pets and their devoted owners.Every Pet Fed festival always has some special memory in our hearts but what always stands out for us is not just dogs and cats. Each year we get to witness a wide variety of pets we never thought and imagined in our lives! From iguanas, hamsters, snakes, to chameleons you name it. Every species shares a special bond with their pet parent.Organizing Pet Fed involves lots of research and experiences and it takes such a toll in our lives because everything is at stake! Initially we faced several challenges like the intricate details of logistics and planning to the complexities of budgeting and securing sponsorships. Marketing and promoting the event, ensuring participant engagement, proactive volunteers, leads and coordinators. Outdoor festivals are susceptible to weather conditions, which can impact attendance and logistics.Contingency plans for unexpected situations are vital.Compliance with regulations, vendor and sponsor management, and prioritizing security and safety add further layers of complexity. Safety and Security is a major concern of our team, where it is essential to be particular and considerate about pets, their owners, participants and team. Feedback collection and progress with every improvement are critical aspects of successful event organization. All it requires and demands meticulous planning, effective communication, and a team capable of addressing a diverse range of issues to deliver a memorable and seamless experience for participants.With in-numerous activities at Pet Fed, there's something for everyone.A masterclass at Pet Fed can be a highly enriching experience for pet parents, offering in-depth insights and expert guidance on various aspects of pet care. These sessions often delve into advanced training techniques, behavior management, and health and wellness practices. Renowned trainers, veterinarians, or specialists may conduct these masterclasses, providing a platform for attendees to deepen their understanding of their pets' needs and behaviors. Whether it's an advanced training masterclass, a deep dive into pet nutrition, or an exploration of holistic well-being, these sessions empower pet parents with practical knowledge and skills. Masterclasses at Pet Fed offer a unique opportunity for attendees to learn from leading experts in the field, enhancing their ability to provide the best possible care for their furry companions.","Pet Fed is like acarnival for petsand pet lovers, with many activities and workshops.

There will be people who will tell you that whatever you’ve done is a masterpiece and those who will vilify you for just existing. Don’t take either of them seriously

Social media is an appendage. There are meaningful conversations, constructive criticism. The rest, there’s always a block button.

Treat your profile as your drawing room, set your own code of conduct

Watch Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, Kala Pani, Joram, and 12th Fail because you need to see every bit of the society we live in, especially in a diverse country like ours

Like it happened in my last life or something, because she looks nothing like that anymore. She’s grown into such a beautiful lady, so elegant and graceful. Then obviously there’s her professional achievement, being a model for an international label. I am overwhelmed and proud, but I also marvel at what time can do. To people, to faces, to lives. She’s that living testimony of the wonders of time.: I think he introduced me to a whole new world. Something I’ve only seen mom and dad do.

A world she was familiar with, thanks to her parents, but her parents were very strict about letting her into that world. I had to convince her parents that she is very comfortable in that world. She belongs there. When she was dancing at a recent party, I told Nilanjanaa (her mother) Look! I told you, she’s very comfortable here.: There was a scene in Uma, where I had to dance and I was moving slowly, softly, it wasn’t working out. And he was just like, “dance,” and I was like “okay.” And then I cried after that because I think I definitely was an introvert up to that point. Gradually it changed and I think I got comfortable with that scene onwards.: I think she cried because when an actor’s inhibition breaks down, you are in touch with your real self, with a world that was behind the wall, you’ve not seen. She was introverted. After that she took off and now look at her!: I think it’s the ‘Don’t be afraid to try’ spirit. I’ve gone with my parents to their shoots and I’ve seen them act. I knew you need a lot of confidence to do what comes to them so easily. There are so many people behind the camera who are watching you act, do something. But you have to play the role you have been given. It requires a lot of confidence and taking the leap is what I’ve learnt from him. Thank you for that! (So I was just having this conversation with her father. I was saying that now looking at her I think, she should come back with a love story. Her father said very interestingly that, I think you should cast her as a serial killer (). I told Jisshu, it’s my fault, I have only given you negative roles, fromtoto, making you a household name for grey characters. But why do I also want to push Sara down there?: Oh! So this has gone to Kajol and still not come to me?! (: It was very spontaneous.: I will make it a point to read some of her stuff.Just some poetry I’ve been writing. Not many people know about this. Now the world’s gonna know about this.: What kind of music do you like?: Kishore Kumar ! () Sara: Do you like Arctic Monkeys or The Neighbourhood?: Arctic Monkeys is something which my niece had once told me about. Not so much into it. What are your thoughts on K-Pop? Worth visiting?: I was obsessed with K-pop. But I think I’ve grown out of it.: What about Korean dramas?: Korean dramas are good. I do enjoy them if it’s a mafia K-drama. Then their romance stuff is good.: What about gore?I am not that great with gore, but if it’s crime and dystopia, I’m completely fine. One of my favourites is pro“I love layered, morally grey characters that can go to extremes. I am intrigued by their motive, their childhood trauma and backstories”“Sara’s ready for a relaunch. If she were to play a serial killer, maybe Jisshu would be the other killer, or the cop on her trail!”“Sara’s strength is her spontaneity and elegance. That’s the essence I captured in Uma. It was the only film I’ve written keeping the character in mind, apart from Autograph, which I wrote for Bumba(Prosenjit)”","SaraSmiles at SrijitSrijit, if you were to cast her in a film now, what kind of a role would it be?

11,"Anirudha Roy Chowdhury: Despite their vast experiences, Amitabh Bachchan and Pankaj Tripathi remain hungry for perfection - Exclusive!","Following your impactful contributions to films such as 'Pink' and 'Lost,' what motivated you to undertake the project of 'Kadak Singh'?

We have a sea of talented actors in Indian cinema; why did you opt for Pankaj Tripathi to play this role?

Have you had the opportunity to watch Pankaj's earlier movies, and if so, which one resonated with you the most?

Pankaj Tripathi reveals real-life gangsters approached him after the success of 'Gangs of Wasseypur'

Having collaborated with both Amitabh Bachchan and Pankaj Tripathi, what common traits or similarities have you observed in their approach to acting?

Among Amitabh Bachchan, Pankaj Tripathi, Jami Gautami, and Taapsee Pannu, which actor would you consider someone who aligns particularly well with the director's?

Is your deliberate choice to frequently explore themes of thrillers, mysteries, and serious social dramas in your films a conscious decision to steer clear of commercial masala films?

In a candid interview with ETimes, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, who is known for his directorials, namely 'Pink', 'Lost', and others, shares insights on a journey behind the scenes of his latest creation, ' Kadak Singh '. As the master storyteller opens up about the inspiration behind the film and the meticulous casting process, the interview provides insight into the deliberate selection of Pankaj Tripathi for the role of the grounded officer grappling with financial fraud.Anirudh praises Tripathi's authenticity, versatility, and less-is-more approach, expressing the conviction that the actor was the perfect fit for the character's complex persona. Not just that, comparisons are drawn between working with acting legends Amitabh Bachchan and Pankaj Tripathi.Below are excerpts from the interview:Whenever I make a film, I have an urge to tell a particular story and evoke certain emotions that I can relate to. These are experiences either I or my close circle have encountered. All my films, be they Bengali or Hindi, are drawn from the atmosphere and events around me. Kadak Singh is a story I wanted to share about financial crimes and how people exploit others, particularly the middle class. The film sheds light on the cheat fund issue, where common people were duped. I may not be a government official, but through my art, I can initiate a conversation and create awareness. Kadak Singh also explores a dysfunctional family and an intense, unnamed love affair, such as the relationship between a nurse and a patient, showcasing emotional and intellectual support. The film emphasises the importance of taking responsibility in life—for nature, the environment, and each other.When casting for a film, I create a wish list. Pankaj Tripathi perfectly fits the role of a grounded officer dealing with financial fraud. His authentic appearance aligns with the character's background. Additionally, the narrative demands a determined yet dysfunctional character, showcasing a complex relationship and retrograde amnesia. Pankaj is a great actor, authentic, and unbelievable. He is super. His less-is-more approach suits the character. When I met him, there was a conviction that he was the perfect fit. It's a symbiotic and organic evolution in casting.I loved his films like 'Newton', 'Mirzapur', 'Bareilly Ki Barfi', and 'Mimi'. Pankaj is a versatile and realistic actor who brings authenticity to every role. His performance in 'Criminal Justice' as a lawyer was particularly commendable.Both actors, despite their vast experience, remain hungry for perfection. Mr. Bachchan, in particular, stays on set, displaying a commitment and integrity that everyone should learn from. Their dedication gives not only an on-screen result but also an energy that enriches everyone around them.In cinema, collaboration is key. A director's role is to inspire, tell a story, and convince. It's about creating harmony and collaboration. Every actor, including Taapsee, Jami, and Pankaj, has contributed positively, and the exchange of thoughts and ideas leads to the creation of a film.My films, whether serious social dramas or relationship-oriented, can be commercial too. The focus is on telling a truthful story with the right intent. Commercial success doesn't necessarily mean following a formula; it's about creating commerce through authentic storytelling. Intent and belief in the story are crucial to me.","Following your impactful contributions to films such as 'Pink' and 'Lost,' what motivated you to undertake the project of 'Kadak Singh'?

In the glitzy world of cinema, where glamour often takes center stage, actor Vijay Sethupati emerges as a beacon of simplicity. With the release of his latest film, ‘ Merry Christmas ,’ today, let's delve into 10 statements by Vijay Sethupati that not only echo his down-to-earth nature but also reveal the simple soul within.During a conversation with Film Companion, Vijay Sethupati expressed his apprehension about excessive exposure, fearing it might disconnect his audience from the characters he portrays. He shared, ""I fear too much exposure, talking so much about films and about myself. I fear I may detach my audience from my characters, and my films. I don’t want to disturb them while watching films. Even on my Instagram, I have only a couple of personal photos. Earlier, there were only one or two award shows and you would get to see actors at very few moments. Now, there is too much exposure, which makes me afraid.”Reflecting on the challenge of providing answers, he stated, ""Bohot sochna padta hai jawaab ke liye, dimaag ka batti nahi jalta hai (I have to think a lot for an appropriate answer. The brain doesn’t work at such times). So, it’s better to keep quiet. If a person thinks of me as an intellectual after watching my film, then let that imagination be. Better to be an intellectual and brilliant actor in someone’s imagination, it’s nice. It’s better than coming and showing myself as a dumb actor. This is not a humble answer, it is real.”In an interaction with Indian Express, Vijay Sethupati opened up about facing body-shaming and the acceptance he found. He revealed, ""Main aisa hi tha, body shaming bohot kiya tha mujhe (I have faced a lot of body-shaming for the way I look). Wahaan bhi kiya tha (they also did it). It happened, but the good thing is that people accept you the way you are. Today wherever I go, I am accepted, it is a blessing. (It’s all) thanks to my audience that I am happy being myself. I didn’t expect this, I didn’t…""Regarding his simple style choices, he shared, ""Sometimes I am conscious about my costumes because I believe in wearing what I am comfortable in. Sometimes people say I am showing off, sometimes they say I am too simple. Chappal pehnega toh simple matlab kya (how is wearing slippers equal to being simple?). But sometimes I am conscious of that also. If I go to functions, I see people dressed up really well, and I get really conscious. So mostly I try to avoid going for get-togethers and meetings generally, otherwise, I am comfortable.""Speaking to First Post, Vijay Sethupati revealed his unwavering commitment to his craft, particularly in the film ""Jawan."" He declared, “I did Jawan only for Shah Rukh Khan sir; even if I didn’t get a single penny, I would have still worked with him.”During a conversation with Pinkvilla, Vijay Sethupati shared his laid-back philosophy towards life. He said, ""I just came to cinema, I wanted to be a serial artist and then became a hero in the film and then everything it happened, maybe I don’t take life that serious. I’m just the flow. When you have a target and you want to achieve something, it’s like already chalna bahut mushkil hai to upar aur zyada vazan rahega aur bhi mushkil ho jaayega (you have a long journey to cover and with mental pressure it will become even more difficult). Just you go. It's nice. You may cross deserts, mountains, seas-everything. It's an experience.""In an interview with PTI, Vijay Sethupati expressed gratitude for the opportunities that came his way, admitting, ""It is a huge blessing and I didn't expect this. I didn't have this much confidence. I was worried about my language (skills). When they approached me for Mumbaikar or Gandhi Talks, I was like I'm going to do only that and it's not going to be many films.""He also emphasized the significance of fan love, saying, ""I believe fans are fans and their love is so true. Receiving love from fans is like an energy drink. When people love you, it gives you hope that your work has reached people they have understood and they really like your work. That’s what I understood from the fan clubs. That always gives me energy.""During a press conference, Vijay Sethupati discussed his initial apprehension about working with Katrina Kaif. He admitted, ""I like Katrina, she has been in the industry for almost two decades. I didn't know how she would behave, so thoda darr tha as I was going to work with her. Suppose the actor has an attitude then it becomes difficult to share the screen with them because the rhythm would not match. But the moment she entered and the discussion began, it was so healthy and sensible. She likes to talk more, discuss more, listen more and everything is more, which made me very comfortable, so the first fear is gone.""","Dedication toin ‘Jawan’Taking life in strideLanguage and confidenceFan loveWorking withKatrina KaifIn the glitzy world of cinema, where glamour often takes center stage, actor Vijay Sethupati emerges as a beacon of simplicity.

It will have five domes, 360 pillars, and 106 spires. It will also have a museum, a library, a research center, and a food court. The temple complex will cover an area of 67 acres, which will also include a garden, a water body, and a meditation center.The consecration ceremony, which is expected to attract lakhs of devotees from across the country and abroad, will be held on January 22, which coincides with the Basant Panchami festival. The ceremony will be performed by the chief priest of the temple, Satyendra Das, along with other priests and dignitaries. The ceremony will involve various rituals, such as the installation of the idol of Lord Ram, the invocation of the deities, and the offering of prayers.

Iran strongly denounces the military strikes by the US and Britain in Yemen, branding them as arbitrary violations of sovereignty. Cities, including Sana'a, Hudaydah, Sa’ada, and Dhamar, witnessed explosions, with confirmed involvement from the US and Britain. Nasser Kan’ani, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, decries the attacks as clear breaches of international laws, intensifying regional insecurity. He links the strikes to US and UK support for alleged Israeli war crimes against Palestinians during the Gaza conflict. Expressing concern, Kan’ani calls for responsible international reactions to curb the spread of war and insecurity. President Joe Biden characterizes the airstrikes as defensive, with a commitment to further action if needed. These attacks align with Israel's contentious military campaign in Gaza, facing resistance and economic costs. Yemeni armed forces targeting Israeli ships contribute to the invasion's economic impact. The US-led aggression coincides with hearings at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces charges of genocide in Gaza. Observers anticipate potential repercussions for the West, particularly the US and Britain, due to their alleged support for the invasion.

29,L'Oréal's next-gen hair dryer uses infrared light to dry up your hair,"L'Oréal , the cosmetics maker, has introduced AirLight Pro , its unique take on the traditional hair dryer , at the CES 2024 , which uses infrared light instead of heating coils to dry up hair.AirLight Pro uses a combination of infrared-light technology and wind , which L'Oréal says provides smoother, more hydrated hair while also drying them faster. Not just that, but this hair dryer also uses up to 31 percent less energy than traditional heat-coil hair dryers, and that is because of the optimised heat flow across multiple hair types.The hair dryer is inspired by the natural process of drying rain.After the rain, wind and sun are the most effective combination to dry out the environment. Guive Balooch, the global vice president of L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator, explains that the same principle can be applied to hair drying. By using a mix of infrared light and powerful airflow, it mimics the effects of the sun and wind, reducing the need for direct heat.Inside the hair dryer, there is a circle of infrared lights powered by tungsten—halogen bulbs, including a smaller circle that generates air. These infrared lights help to dry the water droplets on the surface of the hair while keeping the moisture within the strand.Balooch explains that different wavelengths of infrared light have varying effects on the hair. For example, the red/yellow end of the spectrum is similar to UV light, which is not ideal for hair. In contrast, blue and purple light provides a more hydrating effect. The result is a 30 percent faster drying time and a 31 percent reduction in energy usage, resulting in 59 percent visually smoother and 33 percent more hydrated hair.L'Oréal says that it has tested the AirLight Pro on more than 500 people with multiple hair types.The hair dryer has an app of its own that allows users to customise their heat preferences. Additionally, a set of smart attachments will be included, such as a diffuser and a concentrator nozzle. So, when you attach one of these accessories, the hairdryer will automatically recognize it and adjust the speed and temperature accordingly.The Fairlight Pro is designed in partnership with the startup Zuvi, in which L'Oreal has a minority investment through its corporate venture fund. Zuvi itself sells a $260 Halo Hair Dryer, which uses the LightCare technology found in the AirLight Pro. Balooch explains that the AirLight Pro is the result of combining the knowledge of L'Oréal, which has expertise in the biology of skin and hair, as well as many well-known brands, with Zuvi's technology.AirLight Pro will be available in select markets, including the US and Europe, under the L’Oréal Professionnel's brand for both beauty professionals and consumers in 2024. It will retail for ""under $400.""","L'Oréal , the cosmetics maker, has introduced AirLight Pro , its unique take on the traditional hair dryer , at the CES 2024 , which uses infrared light instead of heating coils to dry up hair.AirLight Pro uses a combination of infrared-light technology and wind , which L'Oréal says provides smoother, more hydrated hair while also drying them faster.

Merry Christmas movie review and release LIVE Updates: 'Both Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi have elevated the writing with their performances the movie' - Sriram Raghavan

'Merry Christmas' finally hits the silver screen today, January 12! The Sriram Raghavan directorial, described as ""a genre-defying tale"" will release nationwide today, giving fans a thrilling start to the new year 2024. Shot in two languages, the film features two distinct supporting casts. The Hindi version boasts a cast including Sanjay Kapoor, Vinay Pathak, Pratima Kannan, and Tinnu Anand, while the Tamil rendition stars Radhika Sarathkumar, Shanmugaraja, Kevin Jay Babu, and Rajesh Williams in equivalent roles.The film also marks Katrina's first on-screen collaboration with Vijay. The actress, a prominent figure in the Hindi film industry, expressed her enthusiasm working with Vijay and declared the South star as ""the best performer."" Sharing insights into their collaboration, she commended, ""Sriram sir gave the actors a lot of space before the shoot, and we had a lot of discussion. When I watched the final result, what I saw between Vijay and my character was surprising.""Vijay reciprocated the praise, acknowledging Katrina's industry experience and applauding her collaborative and open-minded approach on set. At a press conference, the actor recalled, ""I met her first time in Sriram sir's office and as soon as she entered the office there was such a healthy conversation. She likes to discuss more and listen more. There was a better understanding between us on the set. So much I gained and learned from her.""Ahead of the January 12 release, the makers held a star-studded premiere, which was attended by b-town stars including Vicky Kaushal, Sunny Kaushal, Sharvari Wagh, Neha Dhupia, Kabir Khan, Aditya Roy Kapur, Ananya Panday, Radhika Madan, Shanaya Kapoor, and Khushi Kapoor, among others. Originally slated for a December release, the film's promotional campaign included captivating posters, an engaging trailer, and melodious songs, with the latest addition being the soul-stirring romantic love song 'Raat Akeli Thi,' unveiled online on Wednesday.Anticipation now surrounds the box office performance with initial predictions hinting at a nett collection or Rs 2 crore across India on its opening day, spanning both languages. Notably, there is speculation about the potential of this performance marking a significant moment for Katrina Kaif, potentially challenging her lowest opening in a decade, a record currently held by her 2022 release, 'Phone Bhoot'.The film's release timing adds an extra layer of intrigue, considering the historical challenges associated with January releases. While many inaugural January releases in the past 15 years have struggled at the box office, exceptions like Vicky Kaushal's 'Uri: The Surgical Strike' and Ajay Devgn's 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior' offer hope for 'Merry Christmas' as it stands as a solo release in the market. This positioning could allow the film to leverage positive word of mouth, paving the way for a successful opening weekend and an extended run in theaters.Read Less","THE TIMES OF INDIA | Jan 12, 2024, 15:54:00 IST Share Follow usLIVE NOWMerry Christmas movie review and release LIVE Updates: 'Both Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi have elevated the writing with their performances the movie' - Sriram Raghavan'Merry Christmas' finally hits the silver screen today, January 12!

32,Merry Christmas Review: Sriram Raghavan's unwraps a neo-noir surprise in this twisted tale,"Back in town after being away for seven years, a man spends Christmas Eve with a mysterious and lonely woman. The evening takes an unexpected and dark turn that could land him in trouble.Thanks to consuming riveting suspense thrillers and crime dramas relentlessly, audiences can often easily predict twists or crack a mystery. But not with Sriram Raghavan’s movies, and his latest offering is no different. Here, the director not only keeps the suspense veiled, but one can also not foretell what’s going to happen next.The movie begins with Albert (Vijay Sethupathi) returning home to an empty house as his mother passes while he is away for seven years. As his neighbour (Tinu Anand) describes her last few days, Albert decides to step out and take in the Christmas cheer to lift his spirits up. When he helps an attractive woman, Maria (Katrina Kaif), take her mute daughter home, she invites him in for a drink, and sparks fly between them. However, things go awry soon, and the narrative turns into a whodunnit. But the movie is more than that. Maria and the incident remain shrouded in mystery when in comes Ronnie (Sanjay Kapoor), adding to the chaos.The movie is quintessentially Raghavanesque and neo-noir in its tonality. It springs surprises that you least expect, and therein lies his ingenuity. However, not much happens in the film’s first half, and the real action begins only shortly before the intermission. The track of the two strangers spending the evening together overstretches, and the audience’s interest intermittently tapers.The narrative takes wings in the second half and keeps you engrossed right until the end. When you think all’s well that ends well, another track begins. The twist does not seem incongruous but adds another layer to the narrative.Vijay Sethupathi, as the earnest Albert, is outstanding. He delivers funny lines with an effortless poker face. “Fermented kuchh bhi chalega, except dosa batter,” he says to Katrina Kaif’s Maria. A story within the story is as quirky, and Vijay narrates it with finesse. Katrina Kaif delivers a serviceable performance and is excellent in a scene where she lets herself go and celebrates Christmas Eve with Albert. Sanjay Kapoor, Tinu Anand, and Vinay Pathak (as a cop) play their parts well.Pritam’s soundtrack (especially Raat Akeli Thi and Nazar Teri Toofan) and Daniel B George’s background score enhance the film’s moody atmosphere, masterfully created by cinematographer Madhu Neelkandan. Bombay, when railway stations had weighing scales with whirring little discs, has been recreated splendidly. The film’s dialogues also stand out. When Albert points out to Maria that she and her husband look happy in the pictures, despite there being trouble in paradise, she says, “Tum kisiko jaante ho jo rota chehra deewar par lagaate hain?” (Who frames photos in which they look sad?).Although relatively less ominous compared to films in the genre or the director’s previous works, catch this one for the wicked plot and the surprises.

52,Ayodhya airport to follow ‘drop-and-move’ policy on January 22,"LUCKNOW: In view of the fact that the newly inaugurated Ayodhya airport will witness an unprecedented rush on January 22 when the Pran Pratishtha ceremony takes place at the Ram temple , concerned officials have decided to adopt the ‘drop-and-move’ policy.Airports Authority of India (AAI) engineering in-charge and project director Ayodhya Airport Rajeev Kulshreshta said, ""We have completed all the civil and technical work inside the airport and only final touches are being given to the rest of the work.However, on January 22 only about 100 flights (coming and going) would be accommodated. The airport is meticulously managing the influx of these flights, mostly of VVIPs, by allocating tight time slots for both landing and take-off, necessitating efficient coordination to avoid congestion. It would be a drop-and-move affair for all the aircraft as we have limited parking facilities in Ayodhya.”The Ayodhya airport is preparing to handle the January 22 rush on a war footing. Requests for more than 200 flights (chartered and private) have been received by the airport authorities but only about 110 can be accommodated on that day.A senior official of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said, “Ayodhya airport is gearing up to handle more than 100 flights (coming and going included) on January 22, with over 200 flight requests pouring in, comprising both chartered and private flights.”Director, Ayodhya airport Vinod Kumar said, “To handle the overflow, designated parking spaces in nearby airports such as Prayagraj, Kushinagar, Varanasi and Gorakhpur are being utilized. All these aircraft have been given parking slots at different nearby airports like Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar and Prayagraj. This strategic approach aims to alleviate the pressure on Ayodhya airport, ensuring a smooth flow of air traffic.”An official of Air Traffic Control said on condition of anonymity, “Strict adherence to allocated time slots is crucial, as any delay in reaching the airport on time may lead to the cancellation of landing permission or, at least result, in extended wait time in airspace.”This comprehensive preparation reflects the airport’s ability to manage the flight operations effectively, at the same time safeguarding operational efficiency and minimizing disruptions during this anticipated rush on January 22.He said, ""The airport has a 2,200 metres long and 45 metres wide runway which can handle landing and take-off of Airbus A320, ATR-72 and Bombardier private jets. In the second phase the airport would be opened for international flights with the expansion of the runway to 3,200 metres. For night landing, we have IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) and CAT-1 landing facility for landing during fog. Under CAT I facility, the aircraft can land even when the visibility is as low as 60 metres.”The 848-metre-long threshold has also been created which is in addition to the 2,200-metre-long runway. For commercial aircraft operations from Ayodhya airport, the runway has Doppler Very High Frequency Omni Range (DVOR), a homing gate system which is a standard International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) ground-based radio navigational aid besides having Instrument Landing System (ILS).This is the most modern technology used for giving information to aircraft to define air traffic control routes for landing and take-off and its further journey.This technology helps in terminal and instrument approach and departure procedures of the aircraft.However, an official of Lucknow’s Chaudhary Singh Airport said, “The airport has received the orders to make arrangements for parking of 15 aircraft on January 22.”According to an Airport Authority of India (AAI) official source, the staff is especially trained to handle the air traffic. They are trained to welcome the VVIPs and bring them to their designated lounge or vehicles.","The airport is meticulously managing the influx of these flights, mostly of VVIPs, by allocating tight time slots for both landing and take-off, necessitating efficient coordination to avoid congestion.

LUCKNOW: Terming Uttar Pradesh as one of the most progressive states in the country, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that nepotism and caste-based politics under previous governments had created an identity crisis for residents in the past but today people from the state are greeted with happiness and respect.Speaking on Ram temple, Yogi said that under previous governments, people hesitated to talk about Ayodhya but the BJP government brought about a significant transformation in the temple town.“The struggle of 500 years has come to an end. Today, the entire world is eager to visit Ayodhya. The infrastructure, including road, air, and rail connectivity, has seen remarkable improvement. In the new UP of New India, devotees of Lord Ram can experience the sacred sight of Treta Yug in Ayodhya ,” he added.Addressing the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra in Bareilly, where he also inaugurated and laid foundation stones for 170 projects worth Rs 3,405 crore, the CM said, “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, every citizen of the country feels secure, and every eligible individual is getting benefits of public welfare schemes without discrimination.”“Significant development initiatives are being implemented on the ground, positioning India as a global leader. It is a matter of pride for 140 crore people of the country that the world is now looking up to new India,” the CM said. Describing the change in UP after he took over as CM in 2017, Yogi said that earlier curfews would be imposed for months but now grand Kanwar Yatras were taken out. “Now, curfew is imposed in the homes of those who once enforced it. There have been no riots in the state in the last 6.5-7 years,” he said. Highlighting the measures taken by his government to address unemployment, the CM said that six lakh people secured government jobs in the last six years and over 1.75 crore found employment in private sector.“Past governments supported troublemakers, but now police have reined in mischievous elements,” he further said.We also published the following articles recently","Six lakh got govt jobs in past 6 years: CMAyodhya Ram temple design is disabled-friendlyBJP's Divyang cell state unit president Om Prakash claimed that the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will be a ""Divyang-friendly temple"".

55,Ram Temple fervor sparks epic business boom,"Items like Ram Darbar & swings in high demand

INDORE: The enthusiasm and fervour for the January 22 consecration of Ram Lalla idol at Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has given a fillip to local businesses and created employment opportunities for gig workers as demand for puja items, flags, lights, idols, decor products, saffron clothes and earthen utensils have almost doubled.Tailors are the hardest to reach these days as they are swamped with orders to stitch flags with Lord Ram or the Ayodhya temple as motifs.Interestingly, saffron-coloured cloth is fast vanishing from the market as the demand for saffron garments, caps and flags peaks.Gig workers engaged in stitching clothes, polishing idols, fixing lights are so busy that they are rejecting orders, forcing organisers to hire people from other cities.Akash Jain, whose family has been selling puja items for four generations from a shop in Marothiya Market, said, ""Sales have more than doubled. Demand is huge for all 'pujan samagri', like 'hawan' items, kumkum and betel nuts. We have never seen such a surge in demand and sales in this business in 70 years.""Marothiya is one of the oldest markets of Indore and houses 40 pujan samagri shops. The ruling BJP has appealed to people to celebrate the consecration ceremony like Diwali by lighting diyas, decorating temples and organizing programes at markets and homes on January 22. Last week, minister Kailash Vijayvargiya said that more than 1 crore ‘diyas’ would be lit in Indore on the day of the inauguration of Ram Mandir.Idols, brass and copper temple utensils, and related items like Ram Darbar and swings have also seen a sharp jump in demand in a week.Another fourth generation trader, Yugal Jain, of Bartan Bazaar said, “We have called additional staff to cater to customers. The excitement is more than Diwali. We usually see such sales in Diwali but the con- sumer sentiment this time has surpassed all Diwali and wedding season demands.”An organizer of an event proposed at a temple in Rajwada on January 22 said he could not find a vendor to supply him 10,000 flags and jackets in Indore and is now looking for a supplier outside the state.Market associations have announced to decorate shops and light diyas on the day. Some market associ- ations have also organised a series of programmes from January 17.The unprecedented spike in demand has led shopkeepers to maintain high stocks of coconuts, dry fruits, kirana items, décor, lighting and clothes.Arun Vakliwal, member of Maharaja Tukojirao Cloth Market Merchants Association, said, “I sold more than 10,000 flags and clothes in just two days. Demand is in lakhs which is becoming hard to fulfil. We purchase saffron cloth for making flags, caps and jackets from Surat in Gujarat but now they have gone out of stock and this has created a shortage of clothes and flags in the market.”Indore’s Maharani Road market, which houses close to 400 electrical and light shops, has seen a more than 30% jump in demand for fancy and decorative lights, said Rajesh Baheti, president of MP Electrical traders Association.","Demand is huge for all 'pujan samagri', like 'hawan' items, kumkum and betel nuts.

72,Why it is important to have pet festivals,"Pet Fed is like a

carnival for pets

and pet lovers, with many activities and workshops.

What inspired you to create this event for our furry friends and their owners?

Why do you think there is a need for more festivals like this?



How do you think the festival contributes to strengthening the bond between pets and the owners?



Tell us about some pets that remain etched in your memory?



What are the challenges that you initially faced while organising the festival?



What's your personal favorite activity or workshop that you believe every pet parent should experience at least once?

The connection we share with our pets is a special and cherished relationship that brings joy, companionship, and a unique form of love into our lives. It goes beyond a mere companionship; it's a bond that enriches our daily experiences. Akshay Gupta, Founder of Pet Fed, talks in detail about why it is important to have pet festivals and how celebrating your furry friends can go a long way in changing the way we look at them.I started Pet Fed back in 2014 when I realized that there is an event for every liking of a human being in the country whether it is food, fashion, art, music but there was not anything for people who had pets and pets themselves. For every other thing there is a community of people that you can engage, interact and learn with but there was not anything from pet parents so we thought that we will create something of that sort. Pets and pet parents can come together at a common platform and learn from each other and see what is there in the category for better pet parenting.I think we need to have and encourage more festivals like this so that we can promote pet welfare, strengthen the bond between pets and their owners, and build a sense of community among pet enthusiasts. Main focus is to highlight the importance of Adopting the Pet instead of buying and selling them. We always follow our motto #AdoptDontShop and we want our audience to follow this motto. As you know, selling and buying is not good and appropriate, but adoption allows us to freely choose the pet we want without comparing and buying. It provides shelter for the needy. Pet welfare includes the well-being, health, and humane treatment of animals kept as pets. Ensuring good pet welfare involves meeting their physical, behavioral, and emotional needs.The bond between pet and the owners has to be understanding which requires attention and patience to deal with.Organizing events like this can contribute to raising awareness about responsible pet ownership, providing a space for pet-related businesses to showcase their products and services, and fostering a positive environment for pets and their owners to socialize. Pet festivals like Pet Fed play a crucial role in fortifying the bond between pets and their owners. By offering a plethora of shared experiences, from engaging in various activities to participating in workshops, these events create everlasting memories that deepen the emotional connection.The socialization opportunities provided in festival settings help pets become more accustomed to diverse environments and foster positive behavior in social settings. Fun and play activities, alongside pet-friendly services, contribute to the enjoyment and well-being of pets, reinforcing positive associations with the festival experience. Additionally, participating in training sessions and bonding activities encourages effective communication and teamwork between pets and their owners. The sense of community fostered by pet festivals, where owners share stories and tips, further strengthens the support network and a feeling of belonging. Through talent showcases and celebrations dedicated to the unique bond, these festivals become a joyous ode to the special relationship between pets and their devoted owners.Every Pet Fed festival always has some special memory in our hearts but what always stands out for us is not just dogs and cats. Each year we get to witness a wide variety of pets we never thought and imagined in our lives! From iguanas, hamsters, snakes, to chameleons you name it. Every species shares a special bond with their pet parent.Organizing Pet Fed involves lots of research and experiences and it takes such a toll in our lives because everything is at stake! Initially we faced several challenges like the intricate details of logistics and planning to the complexities of budgeting and securing sponsorships. Marketing and promoting the event, ensuring participant engagement, proactive volunteers, leads and coordinators. Outdoor festivals are susceptible to weather conditions, which can impact attendance and logistics.Contingency plans for unexpected situations are vital.Compliance with regulations, vendor and sponsor management, and prioritizing security and safety add further layers of complexity. Safety and Security is a major concern of our team, where it is essential to be particular and considerate about pets, their owners, participants and team. Feedback collection and progress with every improvement are critical aspects of successful event organization. All it requires and demands meticulous planning, effective communication, and a team capable of addressing a diverse range of issues to deliver a memorable and seamless experience for participants.With in-numerous activities at Pet Fed, there's something for everyone.A masterclass at Pet Fed can be a highly enriching experience for pet parents, offering in-depth insights and expert guidance on various aspects of pet care. These sessions often delve into advanced training techniques, behavior management, and health and wellness practices. Renowned trainers, veterinarians, or specialists may conduct these masterclasses, providing a platform for attendees to deepen their understanding of their pets' needs and behaviors. Whether it's an advanced training masterclass, a deep dive into pet nutrition, or an exploration of holistic well-being, these sessions empower pet parents with practical knowledge and skills. Masterclasses at Pet Fed offer a unique opportunity for attendees to learn from leading experts in the field, enhancing their ability to provide the best possible care for their furry companions.","Pet Fed is like acarnival for petsand pet lovers, with many activities and workshops.

78,'MS Dhoni has given me two-three...': Shivam Dube explains the secret behind his transformation,"Wisden picks 2023 men’s ODI team of the year, includes 7 Indians in the XI

NEW DELHI: Marking a dynamic comeback to the Indian team, Shivam Dube played a pivotal role with a powerful 60 not out off 40 balls in the first T20I against Afghanistan. He attributed the positive shift in his attitude and approach to the iconic MS Dhoni , whose influence has been instrumental in Dube's cricketing journey.Dube's impactful half-century significantly contributed to India's comfortable six-wicket victory on Thursday, earning him the well-deserved Player of the Match award.""When I came to bat, I wanted to implement what I have learnt from MS Dhoni about finishing games. I keep speaking to Mahi bhai. He tells me about how to tackle different situations. He has given me two-three tips and rated my batting.""So, I feel if he rates my batting then I'll keep playing well. My confidence went up because of that,"" Dube told 'JIO Cinema'.Dube's previous appearance for India was in last year's Asian Games at Hangzhou.The Mumbai player was part of the India squad for home T20I series against Australia but did not get a chance to play and was not selected for the away series against South Africa.Dube also found shades of Dhoni in the wayRohit Sharma captained the side, and allowed him the space to perform.""Both allow me to bat higher in the order. There's a lot of work to be done and I know they will back me and want me to do well. So, that makes me feel a lot more positive,"" he added.Dube also grabbed the important wicket of Afghan captain Ibrahim Zadran (25 off 22 balls), and the pacer said he has been working on his bowling.""The changes have not come suddenly. In the off-season, I worked a lot on my fitness. After that, I bowled a lot in domestic cricket too so things kept improving.""I was able to find the right areas and also generate a decent pace,"" he said.","""When I came to bat, I wanted to implement what I have learnt from MS Dhoni about finishing games.

84,India need Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to win T20 World Cup: AB de Villiers,"Wisden picks 2023 men’s ODI team of the year, includes 7 Indians in the XI

GQEBERHA: India’s plans to bring Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli back into the T20 mix has drawn mixed reactions. The duo hasn’t featured in a T20I since the 2022 World Cup and with an assembly line of youngsters pushing for a call, questions have been raised on the relevance of the veteran batters, and whether they still fit in the team.South Africa batting great AB de Villiers , however, backed the Indian superstars.Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the washed out Betway SA20 opener between holders Sunrisers Eastern Cape and Joburg Super Kings, De Villiers said: “I’m very happy for Virat and Rohit. Their inclusion in the team (for the Afghanistan series) does not come as a surprise to me because you want your best team to try and win a World Cup. I understand the criticism because of the youngsters that may be missing out.”Drawing a parallel with his own international career which ended in 2018, the 39-year-old said, “I was in a similar position at the backend of my career but it did not work out for me. I’m glad it is working out for Virat and Rohit.”Having spent a decade playing alongside Kohli at the Royal Challengers Bangalore, De Villiers was appreciative of the former’s commitment towards the game.“Virat grew up with cricket in his blood, that’s probably what keeps him going. Cricket has always been his passion. I think he has a fantastic balance in his life with his family,” added De Villiers.‘Newlands pitch looked normal’While the ICC rated the Newlands pitch in Cape Town unsatisfactory after the shortest ever Test match – lasting 642 balls — between India and South Africa earlier in the month, De Villiers had a different take.“The Newlands pitch looked pretty normal to me. It is known for a lively first session on the opening day. If you can fight your way through, it gets a lot easier off the deck.”De Villiers pointed towards poor planning and execution by both teams.“At Newlands, you should always play positive cricket like Aiden Markram did while scoring a century. I think the game plans were wrong by both teams. Yes, it was a difficult, lively and fast pitch but I think the teams could have played better in the first innings.”Since De Villiers called time on his IPL career in 2021, there has been a growing call for him to return to RCB as a coach or mentor.ABD has dropped a subtle hint on social media too a few months back.But clearing the air, the South African said, “Nobody from RCB has contacted me. If I’m asked to be there for a day or two as mentioned by Virat (Kohli (during the World Cup) where he made a live comment, I’ll go spend some time with the team as a friend, not as a coach, mentor or in any such role.

87,"India vs Afghanistan, 1st T20I: Shivam Dube the hot deal on a cold night","MOHALI: One man’s injury is an opportunity for another. As opener Yashasvi Jaiswal woke up with a sore right groin on Thursday, it opened up a chance for another southpaw Shivam Dube . The Mumbai allrounder made full use of the “lucky break”, batting with poise and intent to score an unbeaten 60 off 40 balls (5x4, 2x6) to lead India to a sixwicket victory over Afghanistan in the first of three T20Is at the IS Bindra Stadium here.To say that proceedings in the middle were cold would be an understatement. It was almost freezing! And yet the players from both teams went about the task at hand with professionalism. The fact that most of them had their hands in their pockets for a better part of the match speaks volumes about the scheduling rolled out by the Indian cricket board. Add to that a dash of low-hanging fog which made the condition even more trying for the players.Besides Dube’s smart knock, the sight of Rohit Sharma giving a piece of his mind to Shubman Gill after the youngster played a hand in his captain’s run out for duck, was the centre of conversations going around. Gill cut a sorry figure after the tongue lashing from the skipper.In India’s win, Dube’s support cast was played by the “young brigade” comprising Jitesh Sharma (31 off 20b; 5x4), Tilak Varma (26 off 22b; 2x4, 1x6), and Rinku Singh (16 not out off 9b; 2x4).Afghanistan would have gained more from their batting stint had they done away with the conservative approach in the initial part of their innings. Rahmanullah Gurbaz (23 off 28b; 2x4, 1x6) was unusually sedate. Skipper Ibrahim Zadran (25 off 22b; 2x4, 1x6) was tad better in his approach, but nothing out of the ordinary.The Afghan opening pair gave too much respect to Indian new ball bowlers Arshdeep Singh and Mukesh Kumar . It wasn’t as if the ball was hooping around or seaming. It swung for an over or two, but even after that Gurbaz and Zadran didn’t take the attack to the Indian bowlers. At the end of the Powerplay, Afghanistan had 33 on the board and the opening duo were still at the crease.This was one of the defining periods of the match. Even 15-20 runs more during the Powerplay would’ve put India under pressure while chasing. Perhaps, the intense cold affected the Afghan batters a bit. As they warmed up into their innings, the fours and sixes started the flow. Both Zadran and Gurbaz hit a maximum each after the first six overs before falling in back-to-back overs.The last 10 overs saw the Afghan batters gather 101 runs. Leading the assault was the experienced Mohammad Nabi (42 off 27b; 2x4, 3x6), who took a special liking to leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi’s oft-repeated wrong-uns. Nabi collected a six and two boundaries off Bishnoi. Nabi then smashed two maximums off Mukesh’s bowling and by the end of the 16th over, it seemed Afghanistan would reach at least 170.","As opener Yashasvi Jaiswal woke up with a sore right groin on Thursday, it opened up a chance for another southpaw Shivam Dube .

(With inputs from ANI)

NEW DELHI: India secured a six-wicket victory over Afghanistan in the first T20I after a thrilling encounter at Mohali , taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. The star of the match was Indian all-rounder Shivam Dube , who marked his comeback with an unbeaten half-century and a crucial wicket.Batting at number four, Dube expressed the initial pressure but emphasized sticking to his distinctive style of cricket.""I think it was really cold but I enjoyed playing on this ground. Playing after a long time and batting at No. 4 was a bit of pressure for me, but I had one thing on my mind that I had to play my style of cricket. I know I can hit big sixes in T20s, so I know I can get runs anyway,"" Dube said in the post-match presentation.Dube's impactful performance included an unbeaten 60 off 40 balls, featuring five fours and two sixes. His partnership with Tilak Varma and Jitesh Sharma played a pivotal role in India's successful chase of the 159-run target.When asked about the chat he had with captain Rohit Sharma , who made his return to T20Is after a gap of 14 months, after the match, Dube said, ”He [Rohit] said I played really well and that we'll chat to improve my game in upcoming games. Today I got the opportunity and executed what I had to in bowling.""In the first innings, Afghanistan posted a competitive total of 158/5, riding on a crucial 68-run stand between Azmatullah Omarzai and Mohammed Nabi. Indian bowlers Axar Patel (2/23) and Mukesh Kumar (2/33) were instrumental in restricting Afghanistan's innings. Dube also contributed with the ball, claiming a wicket.The chase saw Shubman Gill 's aggressive start and crucial stands between Dube, Varma, and Sharma.

The shares were valued at $209.57 each for the quarter ended October, implying a valuation of approximately $1 billion for Byju's.

The company's founder, Byju Raveendran , has faced challenges in securing new financing, leading to delays in salary payments for employees in November and other operational difficulties. Raveendran recently assured a group of senior employees that the cash shortage should be resolved within the next 45-60 days.In November, Prosus, a Dutch investor, also marked down its valuation of Byju's to under $3 billion, compared to the $5.1 billion valuation assigned in March of the previous year.

90,"Air fares to go up? New rules on pilot rest & duty period may increase costs leading to higher ticket prices, warns airline industry","Air fares set to go up? India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) is set to implement new rules regarding pilot rest and duty period , which have raised concerns among airline executives. Effective from June 1, executives are of the view that these new regulations will require airlines to either increase their pilot strength by 20% within three months or reduce flight operations to comply with the new rules.While stating that the objective of ensuring safe flying is important, airline executives argue that the new rules are overly restrictive and impractical. According to an ET report, an airline CEO expressed concerns about the feasibility of hiring and training a significant number of pilots within such a short timeframe.The revised rules redefine the night period, extending it by an hour from 12 am to 5 am to 12 am to 6 am. The rules also impose a cap of two landings for the pilot, whereas there was no previous limit. Additionally, the duty period has been limited to 10 hours if the pilot's reporting time falls within the night period, compared to the previous 13-hour limit.Furthermore, the time allowance for exceeding the limit during unforeseen circumstances, such as bad weather or air-traffic delays, has been reduced from three hours to two hours.While pilots have embraced these new rules, arguing that previous regulations on flight times were too lenient, airlines anticipate difficulties in adapting to the changes. Hiring and training pilots, as well as implementing the new duty schedule and publishing the roster, requires a significant amount of time and coordination. Meeting these requirements by the June 1 deadline seems impossible for airlines.Officials responsible for crew scheduling pointed out that a considerable number of flights operated by IndiGo, Air India Express, and Vistara to the Middle East occur during the night period. Similarly, slot-constrained airports in metro cities often have red-eye flights that depart late at night and arrive in the morning.A crew scheduling official highlighted the challenges posed by the new rules, explaining that for morning flights departing at 7 am, pilots must sign in at 6 am. Similarly, for flights ending at 11:30 pm, pilots must sign off at midnight. Consequently, the majority of duty periods fall within this time window, limiting workdays to two sectors.To accommodate these flights, airlines will need additional pilots or arrange overnight stay accommodations for the crew, which will increase operational costs and potentially lead to higher ticket prices, the official said.Aviation consultancy firm CAPA's CEO for South Asia, Kapil Kaul, warned of the severe impact of these new rules, estimating that airlines will require 20% more pilots to maintain their current operations.Senior DGCA officials assured that the new rules were developed after extensive consultation and feedback from the industry. Pilots have long argued that airlines exploit the regulator's lenient rules, resulting in excessive workload and fatigue.","India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) is set to implement new rules regarding pilot rest and duty period , which have raised concerns among airline executives.

91,Pakistan secures final IMF approval for $700 million loan tranche,"Elections

Pakistan won final approval for the disbursement of about $700 million in aid from the International Monetary Fund, providing a boost to the embattled South Asian economy ahead of elections next month.The IMF ’s executive board approved the loan, the Washington-based lender said in a statement on Thursday. The nation’s dollar bonds were among the biggest gainers in emerging markets for the day, with 2026 notes jumping 3.1 cents to about 70 cents on the dollar.Pakistan’s performance under the program “has supported significant progress in stabilizing the economy,” Antoinette Sayeh, IMF deputy managing director, said in a statement posted on the website. “There are now tentative signs of activity picking-up and external pressures easing.”Pakistan’s economy is expected to grow 2% in the fiscal year 2024 after contracting in the previous year, the IMF said. The nation’s dollar bonds delivered returns of over 90% last year as default risks eased following the IMF bailout, catapulting them into the top rankings in emerging markets.The IMF funds are critical for Pakistan to secure financing from other creditors like Saudi Arabia and will give a boost to Pakistan’s caretaker government under Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kaka ahead of elections scheduled for February.Despite the aid, Pakistan remains under financial strain. The nine-month IMF program is set to end in March and Interim Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar has already signaled the nation may need another loan from the IMF to support the economy. Pakistan has about $1 billion in dollar-denominated debt due in April.The IMF said Thursday that Pakistan needs a market-determined exchange rate to buffer external shocks, and a tight monetary stance to ensure that inflation returns to more moderate levels. The nation also needs to boost foreign reserves, the IMF said, with latest data showing reserves stood at $8.2 billion in early January.The rupee has stabilized in recent months after sliding to a record low in early September. The currency traded at 281 rupees per dollar on Thursday.The IMF has now disbursed a total of about $1.9 billion under the program, it said. The approval came after the IMF executive board’s completion of the first review of the $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement program approved in July, and followed a staff-level agreement in November.","ElectionsPakistan won final approval for the disbursement of about $700 million in aid from the International Monetary Fund, providing a boost to the embattled South Asian economy ahead of elections next month.The IMF ’s executive board approved the loan, the Washington-based lender said in a statement on Thursday.

92,Mukesh Ambani re-joins $100 billion club as RIL stock surges,"Mukesh Ambani is once again a centibillionaire .The richest person in India — and in Asia — saw his wealth climb $2.8 billion to $101.8 billion Thursday, as shares of his flagship, Reliance Industries Ltd, rose 2.6% to close at a record high. He’s returning to the $100-billion club for the first time since June 2022, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Ambani, Reliance’s chairman, owns 42% of the company, which has businesses in the energy, telecommunications and retail sectors, among others.Its shares have climbed 22% from a low in October after the firm reported a jump in quarterly profit.The billionaire is the 12th-richest person in the world, ahead of L’Oreal heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers.With a fortune spanning oil refining to supermarkets, Ambani is an outlier among the world’s richest, who predominantly made their fortunes in tech. His rise up the wealth rankings has been steadier than the roller-coaster ride of his compatriot Gautam Adani , India’s former richest person. Adani lost more wealth than anyone else in 2023 after a withering short-seller attack and now sits two spots behind Ambani on the index.Ambani, 66, has helped build Reliance into India’s largest company by market value. In recent years, the business has diversified beyond its fossil-fuel origins toward technology and renewable energy. The listing last year of Reliance’s financial services unit, Jio Financial Services Ltd., helped to broaden the sources of Ambani’s wealth even further.While Jio shares have only gained about 1% since going public in August, the company remains India’s third-largest shadow lender by market value. The firm ultimately wants to develop India’s version of WeChat, a super app that centralizes online shopping, video streaming, digital financing and stock trading, people familiar with the plans have said. In its first set of earnings since it was spun out of Reliance, Jio reported that quarterly profit doubled.Ambani, who was locked in a bitter succession feud with his younger brother Anil about two decades ago, is seeking to avoid a similar power struggle among his three children and has handed operational reins to them.Last year, his eldest son, Akash, an alumnus of Brown University, took over as chairman of wireless operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, while younger son Anant took on the group’s renewable energy flank. His daughter Isha, a Yale University graduate and a former McKinsey & Co consultant, oversees the group’s retail business.

Atal Setu is India’s longest sea bridge and it will be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi today, that is January 12, 2024.MTHL is expected to have a positive impact on the property market in Navi Mumbai, as improved connectivity and infrastructure development are likely to lead to an increase in real estate activity, demand, and prices.The 21.8-km-long MTHL will connect Sewri in central Mumbai to Chirle in Navi Mumbai. It is estimated that around 70,000 vehicles will use this bridge on a daily basis.The MTHL is expected to revolutionize the daily commute for residents of south and central Mumbai, reducing travel time from two hours to just 20 minutes.

118,Maersk to bypass Panama Canal amid drought,"AP Moller-Maersk will use rail transport to avoid the drought-hit Panama Canal , the Danish shipping giant said late on Wednesday, as low water levels have caused one of the world's main maritime trade routes to reduce crossings.The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has reduced the amount and weight of vessels passing through based on current and projected water levels in Gatun Lake, the rainfall-fed principal reservoir that floats ships through the Panama Canal's lock system, Maersk said.""The vessels that utilised the Panama Canal before will now omit the Panama Canal and use a ""land bridge"" that utilises rail to transport cargo across the 80 km (49.71 miles) of Panama to the other side,"" the firm said in an advisory to its customers.Panama's drought has decreased transit slots at the canal, already forcing fuel tankers and grain shippers to take longer routes to avoid congestion.This is adding further disruption to the global shipping network as companies like Maersk and Hapag Lloyd are switching away from the Red Sea after Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen stepped up attacks on vessels in the Gulf region.","AP Moller-Maersk will use rail transport to avoid the drought-hit Panama Canal , the Danish shipping giant said late on Wednesday, as low water levels have caused one of the world's main maritime trade routes to reduce crossings.The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has reduced the amount and weight of vessels passing through based on current and projected water levels in Gatun Lake, the rainfall-fed principal reservoir that floats ships through the Panama Canal's lock system, Maersk said.

119,China ‘Snowball’ derivatives worth $13 billion near loss levels,"China’s relentless stock market rout is putting pressure on $13 billion worth of snowball derivatives , threatening to raise market volatility as brokerages are pushed to liquidate hedge positions.About 30 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) of those structured products tied to the CSI 1000 Index are near levels that trigger losses at maturity, according to Guotai Junan Futures Co.Another 60 billion yuan of the derivatives are 5%-10% away from their knock-in thresholds, the brokerage said.Snowballs promise bond-like coupons as long as the underlying assets trade within a certain range. While that has attracted China’s institutional and wealthy investors over the past years, a seemingly bottomless decline in the stock market has exposed the risk of those derivatives hitting levels that trigger losses.The equity slump continuing into 2024 has set off concerns over risks stemming from such securities. Brokerages hold on to index futures to hedge the exposure that comes with selling snowballs, and the triggering of knock-in levels by some of them has been behind the closing of long positions in equity futures, wrote Guotai analysts including Yu Kan.China’s CSI 300 benchmark has fallen about 4% thus far in 2024, extending last year’s 11% slide. The CSI 500 and CSI 1000 indexes, which snowballs are mostly tied to, closed at their lowest levels since April 2020 and April 2022, respectively, on Wednesday.Similar to autocallables in other markets, a snowball investor loses money if the underlying index falls below a pre-determined level and does not bounce back. The derivatives have grown into a market worth $27 billion in China, though regulators have tightened their grip to prevent them from being marketed to retail investors as fixed-income products.Losses from structured notes tied to Chinese stocks have also become an issue in South Korea, where the regulator is intensifying a crackdown into potential malpractices by brokers.While an extremely bearish scenario of 200 billion yuan of snowballs hitting knock-in levels within a week would trigger a selloff in futures, that would equal to about 2% of an average week’s turnover, CICC said. Still, the episode could deepen the pessimism in the market, the broker warned.Bearish sentiment prevails as market watchers see few catalyst for China stocks. Economic data continue to point to a weak economic recovery, while geopolitical tensions simmer and policy roadmap remains unclear. The market’s weakness has also been attributed to selling and redemption pressures by mutual funds.","China’s relentless stock market rout is putting pressure on $13 billion worth of snowball derivatives , threatening to raise market volatility as brokerages are pushed to liquidate hedge positions.About 30 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) of those structured products tied to the CSI 1000 Index are near levels that trigger losses at maturity, according to Guotai Junan Futures Co.Another 60 billion yuan of the derivatives are 5%-10% away from their knock-in thresholds, the brokerage said.Snowballs promise bond-like coupons as long as the underlying assets trade within a certain range.

125,US SEC approves bitcoin ETFs in watershed for crypto market,"In a significant development for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry, the US securities regulator has given the green light to the first US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track bitcoin , according to Gary Gensler, the Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The SEC has approved 11 applications, including those from BlackRock, Ark Investments/21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco, and VanEck, among others.The products are expected to start trading as early as Thursday, sparking a fierce competition for market share.These ETFs, which have been in the making for a decade, are a game-changer for bitcoin. They offer institutional and retail investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to directly hold it.Analysts at Standard Chartered predict that these ETFs could attract $50 billion to $100 billion this year alone, potentially driving the price of bitcoin as high as $100,000. However, other analysts believe that inflows will be closer to $55 billion over the next five years.""It's a huge positive for the institutionalization of bitcoin as an asset class,"" said Andrew Bond, managing director and senior fintech analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. ""The ETF approval will further legitimize bitcoin.""The price of bitcoin rose by 3% to $47,300 following the news. The cryptocurrency has already surged more than 70% in recent months in anticipation of the approval, reaching its highest level since March 2022 earlier this week. Analysts suggest that success in acquiring assets for spot bitcoin ETFs will depend on fees and liquidity.Some issuers have even lowered their fees in new filings this week to attract investors. These fees range from 0.2% to 1.5%, with some firms waiving fees entirely for a certain period of time.For short-term speculators, liquidity is more important than fees. The more liquid an ETF is, the easier it is for investors to buy and redeem shares at prices that closely track the actual price of bitcoin.Companies are also expected to heavily market these ETFs, with a flurry of online advertisements and other forms of promotion. Some issuers, such as Bitwise and VanEck, have already released advertisements promoting bitcoin.""It is pretty unprecedented, so we'll see how it works. I've never been in a situation where 10 of the same ETF was launched on the same day, so this is a new one,” said Steven McClurg, the chief investment officer at Valkyrie, whose ETF was among those approved on Wednesday.(With agency inputs)","However, other analysts believe that inflows will be closer to $55 billion over the next five years.

132,E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview.That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance.

137,Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently,Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral.

139,India fourth in number of startups with $50 million+ funding: Study,"BENGALURU: India ranks fourth in the world in the number of scaleups, or startups that have received more than $50 million of disclosed VC investment. Ahead of India are the US, China, and the UK, the first edition of Startup Genome 's Scaleup Report said.However, it's ahead of the UK in the total VC investment that has gone into these scaleups, and in the cumulative tech value investment of the scaleups.India, the report says, has recorded 429 scaleups, with a VC investment of $127 billion and total value of tech investment of $446 billion.The report is a research into scaleup success factors, building on the question of what behaviours, resources, and characteristics of startups differentiate those that within four to eight years scaled to $50 million and higher valuations from those startups that didn't.Startup Genome, an innovation policy advisory and research firm, surveyed startups in over 80 cities across more than 40 countries, and looked at 60 plus metrics.The report said India has startups with 50% or more of their customers coming from outside of their continent and have the highest scaleup rate. This can partly be attributed to startups that tailor their products and services to truly global markets - not just beyond their country, but beyond their continent - dramatically increasing their potential customer base.Startups based in large countries (US excluded) scale at a higher rate when they focus on their domestic market. In those countries, the size of the domestic market is so large that it may be worth delaying or forgoing global markets. This is certainly clear in India, where B2C startups can achieve unicorn status and billion dollar exits without going out of the country. Startups with a local connectedness index score of 6 or above achieve a scaleup of 5.1% compared to 3.8% for those with a score of 2 to 4 - a 34% boost. The local connectedness index measures the size, density, and quality of a startup's local network. Early-stage startups with a higher local connectedness index see their revenue grow twice as fast as those with a lower local connectedness index.Scaleup success rate clearly increases with global connectedness, and startups that develop a high level of global connectedness have a 3.2 times higher chance of scaling than those with a low level. Ecosystems that are more connected to top global ecosystems (such as Silicon Valley, NYC, and London) see their startups go global at a much higher rate on average (66% correlations between those very distinct variables).Founders looking to improve their chances of scaling should ensure that they offer stock options for all employees, have more than five global connections to top ecosystems, and have at least three advisers for their startup.","BENGALURU: India ranks fourth in the world in the number of scaleups, or startups that have received more than $50 million of disclosed VC investment.

Kumaravelu, Managing Director, Aquasub Group as the Chief Guest and IPMA’s members from across the country including Pune, Ahmedabad, and Rajkot.While thanking the IPMA members for having elected him as their president, Mr Karthik said that he would focus on increasing the synergy between IPMA, The Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association and Rajkot Engineering Association, the two other major industry bodies represent the 1500-odd pump manufacturers in the organised sector. “We need to promote collaboration among the units which would pave the way for cost savings, improved product design & collective sourcing, and thus help the sector address the global demand of diverse product offerings and competitive pricing.”India’s pump industry is 100 years old. It manufactures more than more than 1 million pumps every year. Agriculture and residential sectors comprise 46% of the market by value, while the industrial sector comprises the rest. The industry is expected to reach US$ 100 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 4% during 2021-2026. India exports pumps to 100+ countries. The sector is providing employment to around 1,20,000 people.Commenting about the strengths and opportunities of the industry, Mr Karthik said that Indian companies had an unique opportunity to test their pumps in diverse and tough field conditions, and used their experience to improve technology. Indian pumps have become world class and can challenge the best in the world. While pumps for agricultural and water supply are the strengths of the Indian companies, the industry is striving to add high value pumps used for mining, waste water, oil and gas to its offerings. “Growing investments globally in irrigation, water and wastewater, mining, and chemical industries present a tremendous scope. We are witnessing an enormous interest in the global market for Indian pumps. Post Covid, pump exports from the country have grown by more than 20%. There is every opportunity for India to be a global leader,” he said. “IPMA will focus on improving the global share of Indian pumps to make the Indian Pump Industry a lakh crore industry by 2030”. Karthik thanked Government of India for providing grants through its department of Heavy Industry towards promoting research and development in advanced pump technologies.He added that by making use of the country’s strength in the IT sector, the industry should up the ante in product design and introduce pumping systems with IoT and smart control features to gain strength in the global market as the customers demand real-time and remote monitoring, optimised energy consumption and predictive maintenance alerts.As for threats, Mr Karthik cautioned that the grey market posed serious challenges to the organised pump industry. The grey market products offer cheap alternatives, but they are made of sub-standard materials; they are inefficient and do not conform to IS standards. He said that IPMA would work with the government to take strict action against the grey market players. While thanking the Government for extending all assistance for expanding the global footprint of Indian pumps, he also requested the Government to consider the industry’s plea for “one country, one product, one standard and one certificate” for pumps as multiple certifications through different agencies are affecting the ease of doing business in this sector.","Karthik, Managing Director, Deccan IndustriesChennai, 25 August 2023:Disclaimer: Content Produced by Deccan IndustriesMr K.V.

142,Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,"NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said.

143,Coinbase CEO Armstrong decries rumors of possible US SEC ban on crypto staking,"Coinbase Global Inc.’s head Brian Armstrong escalated his war of words with the US Securities and Exchange Commission , warning he’d heard rumors the agency wants to ‘get rid of’ crypto staking by retail investors.“I hope that’s not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,” he tweeted on Wednesday, while arguing that the practice of staking is “a really important innovation.”The SEC declined to comment on Armstrong’s tweets.The agency has repeatedly said that most digital tokens are securities that should be subject to its rules. Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated staking could fall under the regulator’s purview. Armstrong argued that staking is not a security.Staking involves earning rewards by locking up coins to help order transactions on various blockchains such as Ethereum. Coinbase, Kraken and other crypto exchanges have waded into staking products to diversify revenues.The firms let users stake coins, without needing specialist computer equipment nor having a minimum amount of 32 Ether, and take a cut of the rewards. Staking on Ethereum can earn yields of about 6%. Coinbase has flagged the progress of its staking services to shareholders.Last August, Coinbase disclosed that it’s being probed by the SEC over its staking programs. The exchange is the second-largest depositor of staked Ether, according to tracker Etherscan.Armstrong has butted heads with the SEC before, such as over a crypto-lending product that the platform had to cancel due to pressure from the agency.Staking services have gathered steam in recent months after Ethereum — the biggest commercial highway in crypto — switched over to the so-called proof-of-stake method of ordering blockchain transactions in September last year.The next phase of Ethereum’s development, an iteration known as Shanghai expected in March, will allow Ether holders to withdraw their staked coins.Bitcoin uses an alternative computational approach known as proof-of-work, which is widely criticized for sucking up too much energy.Proof-of-stake blockchains accounted for 23% of the total market value of digital assets at the end of 2022, according to a report from Staked and Kraken. The report estimated the value of staked assets at $42 billion.An SEC clampdown could drive investors away from centralized exchanges like Coinbase to decentralized staking services such as Lido and Rocket Pool, which may be harder for regulators to pin down.Lido’s LDO token and Rocket Pool’s RPL rallied after Armstrong’s tweets and are up about 5% and 10% respectively over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. That’s even as wider crypto markets sagged Thursday, including a retreat of as much 2.5% in Bitcoin.Coinbase was pummeled last year by a rout in digital assets and the fallout of the collapse of rival FTX. Coinbase’s shares sank about 86% in 2022. They have pared some of those losses by almost doubling so far in 2023 alongside a rebound in cryptoassets.","Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated staking could fall under the regulator’s purview.

148,"Global foray an option under evaluation, leverage Rs 75k crore USOF for devices, services: Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen","NEW DELHI: After success in India, telecom major Reliance Jio sees global foray as an option which is continuously under evaluation at the company, a senior company official said.While speaking to the media at India Mobile Congress , Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen said that India is now a tier 1 plus country and there should be no apprehension in framing policies that are right for the nation.“We think the opportunity for India to go global is big. Reliance will continue to review options to see how best to represent India globally and offer value to customers leveraging the technology capabilities that we have already operationalized in India,” Oommen said.He said that to truly drive the Digital India vision, the government should start leveraging Rs 75,700 crore Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) not just for mobile tower deployment but to make devices and services affordable and accessible for individuals.He said Jio Bharat Phone ecosystem is an enabler to 2G mukt Bharat and AI Yukt Bharat.He said that the underutilised USO fund should be leveraged for not just telecom infrastructure but also giving help to individuals for devices and services for those who cannot afford the transition.""Anyone who cannot afford connectivity or monthly rent should be given a device and service model by leveraging the fund,” Oommen said.The government at present charges 8 per cent of telecom companies' revenue as licence fee. Out of this, 5 per cent of the collection is earmarked for USOF which is utilised for promoting telecom connectivity in rural and remote areas.Oommen said that the 5 per cent collection for USOF should be removed and licence fees should be reduced to 3 per cent.“Let the telecom industry use those funds for continued investment. Give these as an incentive to the telecom industry to expand and enhance not just connectivity but for adoption of services by the needy to move to 4G and 5G services. There is no rationale to keep the users in the 2G era,” Oommen said.He said that devices are a very critical equation in the adoption of any service.""We brought the most affordable 4G device and the 4G adoption increased. Now the 5G devices are coming in the Rs 10,000 range and we see more and more and more 5G adoption happening. But we need to get this even lower,” Oommen said.He said that it is critical for the telecom industry to take along 240 million 2G users to grow them and connect them with modern networks.When asked about views on sustainability of the industry with current mobile call and data price, Oommen said the industry should ensure including the whole of India under the Digital India programme at the time of deciding on tariff.“Increasing the tariffs is the easiest thing that one can do but having the right tariff that takes all of India together is what I think as an industry we need to continue to embrace. That's how we will get 2G-mukt Bharat. Otherwise, you will leave over 200 million of India behind,” Oommen said.Talking about satellite communication technology, Oommen said the technology has evolved to a level that it will complement other land-based telecom networks.He said that the spectrum allocation methodology for mobile networks and satellites should be the same.“We absolutely believe, since satellite offers the same services, to the same devices, to the same customers with similar standards, why should it be considered any different. There seems to be no logic at all. Anything other than auction of the spectrum will distort the market significantly,” Oommen said.He said that Jio has demonstrated gigabit speed using satellite communications technology which is no different from the speed that can be transmitted on land based networks.","Give these as an incentive to the telecom industry to expand and enhance not just connectivity but for adoption of services by the needy to move to 4G and 5G services.

158,"Budget 2024: Social security to millions of domestic workers? Minimum wage, pension under consideration","e-Shram portal

Budget 2024 : Ahead of the upcoming general elections in April-May, the government is contemplating rolling out social security benefits to millions of domestic workers . This move signifies a potential step towards the realization of universal welfare payments as outlined in the Social Security Code of 2020 , which is yet to be implemented.Under consideration are various benefits such as minimum wage, pension, medical insurance, maternity benefits, and provident fund for domestic workers.A senior government official told ET that various options are being explored, but a final decision will be made once the government has an accurate count of domestic workers in India.The Social Security Code categorizes domestic staff as ""wage workers,"" thereby entitling them to wage-related benefits once the code is put into effect.It is important to note that the code incorporates existing social security laws and schemes, including the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions (EPF & MP) Act, Employees State Insurance (ESIC) Act, and the Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act. Consequently, social security schemes provided under these acts will continue to be available under the code once it is implemented.However, it is worth mentioning that not all states have framed rules under the four labor codes drafted by the Central government in 2019-20. The Social Security Code is one of these four codes. To ensure a smooth rollout of the labor codes, the Central government aims to have all states on board.The proposed scheme will outline the benefits, contribution rates, and the distribution of shares among beneficiaries, employers, and the government. The Ministry of Labor and Employment's Labor Bureau has conducted a comprehensive survey of domestic workers nationwide, which is currently being finalized. The government will analyze the data and work profiles to ascertain the cost implications and develop the framework for the proposed social security benefits.The survey findings will also shed light on various socio-economic aspects of domestic workers, including household size, social groups, and economic activities.The government has established the Aadhaar-seeded e-Shram portal, which serves as a comprehensive database for unorganized workers, including domestic employees. Since its launch in 2021, over 292 million unorganized workers have been registered on the e-Shram portal as of December 15, 2023.According to the National Domestic Workers' Movement, the official estimate of domestic workers stands at 4.2 million. However, experts suggest that the actual number could be over 50 million, with 75% of them being women.Labour economist KR Shyam Sundar highlighted potential complications in including domestic workers under the code. He stated that the code lacks a clear definition of domestic workers, unlike building workers and platform workers who are clearly defined for the purpose of social security benefits.","e-Shram portalBudget 2024 : Ahead of the upcoming general elections in April-May, the government is contemplating rolling out social security benefits to millions of domestic workers .

159,Budget 2023: Should you convert physical gold to Electronic Gold Receipt from April 1? Explained,"How EGRs work

Top investment ideas 2023 - MFs, gold, real estate or Fixed Deposits? Explained

Let us see the following example for better understanding of the proposed amendments:

Case-1

Case-2

Conversion of physical gold to EGR

Can there be a shift in consumer spending in the jewellery space?

Grant Thornton Bharat Budget 2023 Explainer: Indians have always cherished Gold as an investment, for its ability to provide liquidity, safety, returns and act as a hedge against inflation. To incentivise India to make disclosures on the physical form of gold they carry at home and strengthen tax structure for the future, the finance minister has incentivised the conversion of physical gold to Electronic Gold Receipt ( EGR ) and vice versa which will be excluded from the purview of capital gain tax .This means that if you wish to convert physical gold to digital gold, there will be no capital gains or tax. As per the current income tax regime long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax is applicable when the gold is sold after three years of purchase.EGRs are a form of depository gold receipts that can be traded on stock exchanges. EGR is an electronic receipt issued by the Vault Manager against the gold deposited with them. You can buy or sell EGRs the same way you buy and sell stocks from stock exchanges. If you want to convert your physical gold to digital, you can do that by depositing it with the designated vault manager. After it is sourced, a depository receipt is created which allows you to trade gold on the exchange.Also, if you have an EGR you can obtain physical gold by requesting the depository for the same. In such a case, the vault manager will deliver the gold to you and extinguish the EGR. As an individual (not in the business of investing) when you sell EGRs, which were held for more than three years, you are subjected to a tax rate of 20% after giving benefit of indexation.Indexation is applied to give the investors the benefit of inflation over the years. In case the holding period of such receipts is less than 3 years, the gain on sale of such receipts is taxed as short-term capital gains as per the applicable income tax slab.The cost of acquisition shall be the original cost at which the gold was purchased prior to the conversion , and the holding period for calculating capital gains shall include the period for which the gold was held by the investor before conversion into EGR.Mr A bought 10 grams of physical gold from the market at Rs 30,000 on May 1, 2013 and in the financial year 2022-2023, he wishes to convert the same into EGR. He can now go to a SEBI-registered vault manager who would help them with such conversion. As per the proposed amendment, Mr A would not be liable to capital gains tax on conversion of such gold to EGRs.Post such conversion, Mr A sold such EGRs on June 1, 2024 for INR 80,000. For the purpose of calculating capital gains on sale of EGRs, the capital gains would be calculated on Rs 50,000 (post indexation benefit) and period of holding would be calculated from date of buying physical gold (May 1, 2013) to date of sale of EGRs (June 1, 2024). In this case the capital gains would be treated to be long term in nature and would be taxable at 20 percent.Mr A did not sell the EGRs but has again converted the same into physical gold. Post such conversion, he sold the same for Rs 90,000 on 31 March, 2025.As per the proposed amendment, Mr A would not be liable to capital gains tax on conversion of such EGRs to physical gold.For the purpose of calculating capital gains on sale of gold, the capital gains would be calculated on Rs 60,000 (post indexation benefit) and period of holding would be calculated from date of buying physical gold (May 1, 2013) to date of sale of EGRs (March 31, 2025).The proposed amendments as discussed above, provides a breather to investors and should pave the way to promote the adaptability of digital gold in India.In case of conversion of EGR to physical gold, the owner of the EGRs places a request with the depository. The vault manager executes the conversion to physical gold and the depositor collects the gold from the vault location.LGDs ( lab-grown diamonds) are an innovation-driven emerging sector with high employment potential for the country. It is believed to have the same properties of that of the natural diamond. In recent years, LGDs have been so finely crafted that their use in the jewellery sector as gems is picking up. Given the availability of LGDs, gems made up of these are priced significantly low as compared to natural diamonds. By 2030, the global market volume of lab-grown diamonds is forecast to be nearly 19.2 million carats.To promote the indigenous manufacturing of such LGDs, the finance minister has stated that the custom duty has been waived off from an existing 5% on import of seeds used for growing these diamonds. She also announced a grant to IITs to facilitate the growth of LGDs in India.Given that customs duty has been waived off on ""seeds"" required to manufacture the LGD and not the LGD itself, and jewellery will be manufactured using the LGD, hence creating multiple layers before reaching to the final price, any value assessment of impact will be very far stretched right now.However, if the duty benefit provided by the budget is passed on to the consumer, the prices of the LGDs and/or jewellery made therefrom shall become somewhat cheaper.Though recently the customs duty on dore bars of gold and platinum was increased, their imports have not seen any decline post that. Now the government has increased the duties on dore bars of silver too.Further, since the duty on articles made up of precious metals like gold, silver, platinum and imitation jewellery has increased, you can expect a hike in their prices. It will be interesting to see if consumer behaviour will see any shift from the traditional precious natural stone jewellery to the emerging lab grown jewellery in the near future.","ExplainedLet us see the following example for better understanding of the proposed amendments:Case-1Case-2Conversion of physical gold to EGRCan there be a shift in consumer spending in the jewellery space?

160,Budget 2023: Sharp focus on green growth heralds much-needed boost for bioenergy,"Harnessing bioenergy is a global trend...

...and is catching up in India, too

To list a few milestones:

The 10% ethanol blending target was achieved in June 2022, five months before the deadline

The deadline for 20% ethanol blending has been advanced to 2025 from 2030

The target of 5% blending for biodiesel stays at 2030 as originally envisaged in the National Policy on Biofuels, 2018

There is much headroom for growth

The road ahead

(Sourav Mitra is Director - Consulting, CRISIL Market Intelligence & Analytics. Views expressed are personal)

The sharp focus on green growth in the budget for next fiscal heralds a much-needed boost for bioenergy , particularly compressed biogas (CBG). With a population of over 1.4 billion today, India is expected to see its energy requirement increase 3% per annum between 2021 and 2030.However, the country’s energy mix is skewed heavily towards fossil fuels , which it imports in large measure.That sits ill at ease with India’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2070 and, as part of that, its target of a 45% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030.Thus, adopting clean and sustainable strategies, including a shift to renewable, non-polluting energy sources, is the need of the hour. Added to this, India faces the challenge of efficiently disposing its agricultural waste, which could be used to offset the need for fossil fuels to a significant extent.Viewed in this context, the budget provisions are all too timely and will encourage stakeholders to take harnessing and use of bioenergy to the next level.Among the measures, around Rs 10,000 crore has been earmarked for setting up 200 biogas plants, including 75 in urban areas, as well as 300 cluster-based or community plants. The mandatory 5% target (by volume) for natural gas marketing companies to inject CBG into the gas market is notable, too. City gas distribution entities, on their part, will benefit from the excise duty exemption for the goods and services tax paid component of CBG-blended compressed natural gas.Adoption of bioenergy has grown by leaps and bounds around the world in recent decades.Take Brazil, for example. About 50 years ago, the country was dependent on oil imports, which led to an energy crisis as supplies fell short. That sparked the advent of bioethanol there.Today, Brazil is a leading player in this space. Indeed, bioenergy has so far contributed more than $200 billion to Brazil’s forex savings and reduced pollution levels in cities such as São Paulo, which has a population similar to New Delhi.India ventured into bioenergy over two decades ago when it launched the pilot programme for ethanol blended petrol. But the segment gathered pace only from 2014, when the government lay more emphasis on it.Going forward, biogas will play a vital role in guiding the Indian economy towards strong and sustainable growth. For one, it can be effectively used as CBG in transport as well as make the country self-reliant in biogas generation.Bioenergy has immense potential for adoption in India, given our unique agrarian profile.According to estimates, while biomethane consumption is low at present, it could reach 15 million tonne oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2040. Among biofuels, bioethanol is expected to log a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% to 5,412 million litre by 2027 from 3,250 million litre in 2020. Biodiesel is expected to clock 4.8% CAGR from 170,000 tonne in 2021 to 260,000 tonne in 2030.This implies abundant opportunities for players seeking to explore bioenergy and signals scope for India to move towards its goal of becoming an energy exporter instead of importer.The boost for biofuels can also help reduce import dependence, especially for crude oil, which stood at a mammoth $119 billion, or Rs 9.35 lakh crore, in fiscal 2022. This has already been proven as the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP) has led to forex savings of Rs 41,500 crore and reduction of ~27 lakh tonne of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the past eight years.The combination of rising demand, strong government push, and innovations provide corporates and entrepreneurs alike ample opportunity to be a part of India’s growth story towards a cleaner future.There are challenges, too, and these will require the energy and allied sectors and the government to work together to build strong foundations.Broadly, the challenges are in three areas — supply chain, finance, and policy.Supply chain challenges stem from the difficulties in collecting feedstock in the form of agricultural waste. Feedstock needs to be collected in 15-30 days, depending on farming cycles, but the collection mechanisms are currently insufficient.Hence, farmers need to be incentivised for quicker collection, and easily accessible storage channels and local manufacturing of collection machines ramped up. This will play into the final cost economics for the consumer as producers will pass on the additional cost. The government can also invest in infrastructure for efficient collection of agricultural waste, which will benefit farmers and businesses alike adequately.As for finance, the nascence of bioenergy as a sector and its capital-intensive nature have translated into some degree of scepticism towards it by financiers and diminished business viability for entrepreneurs.Here, it is important to establish a framework to gauge project riskiness under the ambit of project financing and through the involvement of specialised lenders for renewable energy. Including bioenergy in the priority sector lending category could provide an impetus to financiers and enable entrepreneurs to play a more active role in bioenergy.On the policy front, the government has made its commitment to bioenergy clear through schemes such as National Policy on Biofuels and Sustainable Alternative towards Affordable Transportation. In the longer run, policy interventions such as tax holidays, preferential treatment in purchase policies, and clear financing mandates for bioenergy will be important enablers.","Views expressed are personal)The sharp focus on green growth in the budget for next fiscal heralds a much-needed boost for bioenergy , particularly compressed biogas (CBG).
The mandatory 5% target (by volume) for natural gas marketing companies to inject CBG into the gas market is notable, too.
About 50 years ago, the country was dependent on oil imports, which led to an energy crisis as supplies fell short.
This will play into the final cost economics for the consumer as producers will pass on the additional cost.
In the longer run, policy interventions such as tax holidays, preferential treatment in purchase policies, and clear financing mandates for bioenergy will be important enablers.","['collection', 'boost', 'policy', 'ethanol', 'green', 'growth', 'sharp', 'heralds', '2023', 'muchneeded', 'india', 'tonne', 'target', 'bioenergy', 'energy', 'gas', 'budget', 'focus']"
161,Budget: Union Budget 2023: Stepping stone towards Aatmanirbhar agriculture,"(Satyam Shivam Sundaram is Partner, Government and Public Sector, EY India. Views expressed are personal)

The Union Budget lays the foundation for the financially inclusive and digitally propelled Aatmanirbhar agriculture sector for India. Supply chain inefficiencies in the sector have been Achilles’ heels and the announcement of the Agri Accelerator Fund is a welcome step to unlock the potential. It also converges with the government’s focus on start-ups.Young agripreneurs would be encouraged to focus on solving local challenges and constraints in the Agri-supply chain.This may help arrest the migration of youth from villages to a certain extent and make agriculture an exciting sector for provisioning technology-enabled services across the agriculture value chain including storage.Further, the creation of decentralized storage capacity, as announced in this Budget, will not only arrest the post-harvest loss but also be an enabler and catalyst for increasing farmers’ returns when coupled with the 10,000 FPO program, Operation Greens and eNWR (electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts) thereby contributing towards doubling farmers’ income. This should be complemented with standardization and quality assaying, which would be key to ensuring efficiency in asset creation and operation.In recent years, there has been an increased focus on horticulture. However, the sector has been constrained due to a lack of clean planting material. The Aatmanirbhar Clean Plant Programme announced in the Budget will not only help improve the availability of disease-free clean planting material but also help raise plant productivity and lower crop care cost. Some estimates suggest that productivity enhancement could be up to 50%. This program will meet the twin objectives of increasing horticulture production and enhancing farmer income.The push for developing 10,000 bio-input resource centres to aid natural farming would not only benefit one crore farmers to be brought under the scheme but also improve soil quality and play a larger role in reducing green gas emissions of the livestock sector, import reduction for chemical fertilisers and ultimately improving consumer health.The commitment to other farmer-centric programs including the development of 10,000 farmer-producer organizations (FPOs), and other central sectors as well as centrally sponsored schemes is seen continuing from the previous budget. On the value addition, there is an increase of Rs 250 crore for PMKSY and more than Rs 700 crore and Rs 300 crore for PLI Schemes and PMFME respectively.Last but not the least, digital public infrastructure for agriculture and the focus on AI is expected to boost the information availability for better planning, policy making, and regulation of the sector. It will enable improved access to requisite inputs, credit, demand-led production, better crop management, and post-harvest activities.","Views expressed are personal)The Union Budget lays the foundation for the financially inclusive and digitally propelled Aatmanirbhar agriculture sector for India.

The Union Budget this year came with welcome changes for different categories of taxpayers. Unlike the previous years, the Hon'ble Finance Minister doled out some benefits for literally every cross-section of people - women and their daughters, senior citizens, professionals, high net-worth individual and the public. Introduction of standard deduction in New Personal Tax Regime (""NPTR""), changes in the basic exemption limit, changes in the income tax slab rates, reduction of the peak marginal tax rate, increase in gross receipts limits for presumptive income for professionals, etc.are all strong positives and a hit with the public. So, there is a strong 'feel good' factor all around.However, several of these benefits came with an important pre-condition attached – namely participation in the New Personal Tax Regime. And there are some changes which are bound to leave some sections deeply unhappy. So, what are some of the key elements which have been left out, contrary to our expectations? Let us take a closer look at three big misses of this Budget.Most of the beneficial tax provisions such as higher basic exemption limit from Rs. 2.5 lakhs to 3 lakhs, rationalization of tax slabs, bringing down the peak surcharge from 37% to 25%, income limit for 100% tax rebate from Rs. 5 lacs to Rs. 7 lacs are all tagged to NPTR. So far, most people continue to opt for the old tax regime as popular exemptions and deductions like HRA, LTA, Chapter VIA deductions (covering PF, PPF, insurance premia, medical insurance, NPS contributions, etc.) as these are important elements of spend for the common man.While the Government wants to simplify the tax regime and continue with only NPTR in future, the disallowance of exemptions and deductions under this regime may not help achieve this objective in a hurry. Further, knowing that largely the low- and middle-income group puts money in different options to save and invest, taking away deductions and exemptions under NPTR will discourage them. Just like the FM brought in standard deduction into the NPTR for salaried people, introducing these existing deductions into the NPTR along with a sunset clause might have been a more fruitful approach.The provisions related to CG were in urgent need of simplification. Factors like different category of assets, period of holding, multiple tax rates, indexation/ deeming/ grandfathering provisions, criteria for exemptions, reporting requirements etc. play a pivotal role in computing the correct income and taxes but are very difficult to comprehend. Rationalization and simplification of this gamut of provisions could have helped the taxpayers compute the resultant income and taxes correctly and easily.As we all know, the Indian Government has been taking several steps to make tax compliance easier for taxpayers. Mandatory online filing, linking of Aadhaar and PAN, faceless and online assessment procedures, linking of bank accounts with PAN for faster processing of refunds, easy access to personal data via Form 26AS, AIS, etc. – all these measures have resulted in a remarkable reduction in average processing period of returns from 93 to 16 days! As the FM mentioned, 45% of the returns get processed within 24 hours these days. This is no mean feat and really makes a difference to taxpayers.Now is the time to forge ahead towards the next level of change. There are practical challenges faced by the taxpayers while complying with all the requirements. The set algorithms in the department's technology and software do not adapt to different and unique situations which the taxpayers might have during return filing or other compliance procedures. For example, Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) is a must to avail the tax treaty relief but in a situation where the TRC is not issued by the foreign jurisdiction, the taxpayers face genuine hardship in claiming this relief. This goes against the spirit of double taxation avoidance agreements, where India is a signatory to the agreed protocol with another country.Another situation is where e-verification of Form 67 for an individual who has already left India and does not have access to the available modes of e-verification. It is impossible for such individual to follow the online steps required by the software. Again, where the overseas tax return is not available before the due date of filing India income tax return/ revised return owing to the timing difference between the two countries, the taxpayers are not able to claim foreign tax credit, which rightfully belongs to them. The Government needs to look into these with urgency.This year's proposals are clearly aimed towards simplification and reduction of administrative time of taxpayers, employers as well as the tax authorities on compliance procedures. Some of the above points would add to this objective. We hope this is an early enough call-out to the Government to take the necessary steps in this regard.","Also Read |New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR):Taxpayers must be smiling... thumbs up from me to budget: Ishita SenguptaCapital gains(CG) tax:Procedural hassles:Explained: Budget takeaways for your money - tax, salary, senior citizens & moreAlso Read |(Ishita Sengupta is Partner and India Leader at Vialto Partners.

NEW DELHI: Former West Indies captain, Clive Lloyd , expressed confidence in Indian batting maestro Virat Kohli 's ability to achieve remarkable milestones in cricket , including surpassing Sachin Tendulkar 's record of 100 international centuries.Lloyd, who was in Kolkata for an event, praised Kohli's current form and stated that the former Indian captain, currently holding 80 international centuries, is young enough to achieve anything he sets his mind to.""I do not know about the period, but he is young enough, and I am sure that the way he is playing he can achieve anything he wants to achieve, and it would be something to be quite happy to achieve,"" Lloyd conveyed to the media during the event.While acknowledging the significance of T20 cricket , Lloyd advocated for a balanced cricketing calendar with an emphasis on Test cricket . He expressed his preference for more long-format matches, including three and five-match Test series, rather than shorter two-match series.""At the moment probably they are having too many T20s and stuff. I would like to see a little bit more Test cricket. And if you are playing Test cricket, I would prefer three Test matches or five matches,"" Lloyd remarked.He cited the recent India-South Africa Test series featuring only two Tests as an example of the format needing more prominence.Lloyd characterized T20 cricket as an ""exhibition"" and emphasized the importance of Test cricket as an ""examination.""He expressed concerns about young players focusing on hitting boundaries to secure contracts, stating, ""Our youngsters seem to be getting this habit of trying to hit the ball out of the ground so that they can get a contract somewhere else.

171,"India vs Australia, 5th T20I: Bowlers come to party for India, help hosts defend modest total and win series 4-1","BENGALURU: Australian cricket team’s 10-week Indian sojourn ended on Sunday and it felt like the home batsmen were determined to hand them a farewell gift. But the bowlers were clearly not in a generous mood. Led by a fine show by the bowlers led by young spinner Ravi Bishnoi (2/29), India pulled off a six-run win to wrap up the five-match T20 series 4-1 on Sunday.India skipper Suryakumar lost the toss again and was invited to bat. After a series of misfires, India found saviours in Shreyas Iyer (53; 37b; 5x4; 2x6) and cameo stars Jitesh Sharma (24) and Axar Patel (31). Restricted to 160/8, India defended the total as Australia finished with 154/8. At one point, the away side were relatively untroubled in the chase with Ben McDermott (54; 36b) having a go at the bowlers.But Indian pacers turned on the heat in the 14th over and Mukesh Kumar (3/32) with twin strikes of Matthew Short and Ben Dwarshuis in the 17th over changed the course of the match. Also, Mukesh bowled a seven-run miserly penultimate over and Arshdeep defended the 10 runs required of the last over.The aspirational Indian batting line-up, which in the previous four matches had exhibited a brand of cricket which offered promise and showcased potential, failed to turn up. Instead, most of them looked at sea on a tricky surface which was slow and testing. It was a test of skill and application and the top and middle order, barring Iyer, failed to pass the test.The openers – Yashasvi Jaiswal (21) and Rituraj Gaikwad (10) – played contrasting innings on a surface which was unlike the typical belter the venue offers. Gaikwad struggled to find the gaps and a slow outfield due to rain and overcast conditions didn’t help the cause either.In contrast, Jaiswal heaved a massive maximum off Hardie over midwicket to warm-up for what could have been an innings which could have gone deep into the night. The southpaw, after smashing Jason Behrendorff (2/38) for a six and four, miscued a short ball high into the sky which didn’t go the distance and was taken with precision by Nathan Ellis.Gaikwad joined Jaiswal in the dressing room after just three deliveries. Looking to break free, Gaikwad picked a delivery from Dwarshuis to hit it down the ground, but failed to get elevation or distance and ended up offering Behrendorff a regulation catch.Suryakumar’s (5) dry run with willow in Raipur spilled over to Bengaluru. He was dropped by Ben McDermott, off the second ball he faced.

But then, wherever I was, I realised that people were coming up to me and they were appreciating everyone’s effort, how well we played. I feel for all of them. They all, along with us, were dreaming of lifting that World Cup, along with us,” Rohit said.He added: “Everywhere we went during this entire campaign, there was so much support from everyone who came to the stadium firstly and people who were watching it from home as well. I want to appreciate what the people have done for us, in that one-and-a-half-month period. But again, if I think more and more about that, I feel quite disappointed that we were not able to go all the way.”The team stepping out to represent the country carried a piece of heart of every Indian, shouldering not only their own expectations but also the hopes of fans worldwide.Rohit revealed that fans continued to shower them with all love possible, and make their appreciation known to him in whatever brief moments he came across them.“For me, to see people coming up to me and telling me that they were proud of the team, (it) made me feel good. Along with them, I was healing as well. I felt, okay these are the kind of things you want to hear,” Rohit said.He further said, “People, when they understand what the player must be going through and when they know these kind of things and not to bring out that frustration, that anger, it means a lot for us. For me, definitely it meant a lot because there was no anger, it was just pure love from people that I met and it was wonderful to see that. So it gives you motivation to get back and start working again and look for another ultimate prize.”Rohit has been a cricketer who has seen success par excellence. Years of training, from sweating it out as a young kid dreaming big in the hustle of Mumbai to captaining India at the biggest cricketing stage possible, a sense of intuition, muscle memory seemed to have taken over as Rohit has let his bat dictate proceedings.Rohit walked out each time this tournament with an aura of assurance around him as a leader. From giving impactful starts, to making timely tactical moves that turned games around.“I’ve always grown up watching the 50-over World Cup. To me that was the ultimate prize, the 50-over World Cup.

If you don’t get through it, don’t get what you want, what you’ve been looking for all this while, what you were dreaming of, you get disappointed.

We need to keep a balance. Other teams also came to India to compete in the World Cup. We shouldn't create so much hype. We need to look at sports as sports only. Whoever plays good on the day, we need to respect that.

Kapil doesn't know if the pressure of occasion gets to them.""I think today's players can answer how much pressure they feel. We can only feel,"" he said.However there are shortcomings which needs to be taken care of, Kapil stated, without specifying what they were.""If they (India) win it feels really good. There are shortcomings which we need to address. It is not that you won't have shortcomings after a win. What's most important is to rectify them,"" the 63-year-old said.He urged fans to celebrate what India achieved rather than what they missed out.""They (India) won 10 matches in a row. Is it not enough? We should look at other teams as well. We shouldn't compare anyone. What is important is to see whether they played good cricket or not. We played very good cricket. Final day was not ours so be it,"" the 1983- World Cup-winning captain added.Kapil cited the examples of South Africa and defending champions England to prove his point.""We should look at performance of other teams as well like, South Africa, England who were the defending champions, they finished last (seventh).""Kapil also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's gesture to visit the Indian dressing room and console the players after the final loss in Ahmedabad on November 19.""If the Prime Minister doesn't encourage, who will? He is the No.1 man in the country and if he supports, it feels good,"" he said.The former all-rounder also refrained from commenting on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma 's future in T20 Internationals.""This is selectors job and we should leave it to them. It is not good to comment on everything. They are responsible and what they feel good, they should do,"" he said.The second edition of the Kapil Dev Grant Thornton Invitational golf tournament, sanctioned by Proffesional Golf Tour of India, will have prize purse of Rs 2 crore this year, double the amount from last year.Title holder Varun Parikh will try to defend his title in the tournament beginning on Wednesday at the DLF Golf and Country Club here.Kapil said some former cricketers including Murali Karthik, Madan Lal, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh are expected to be present on the final day of the event on December 3.He also said he would request Sachin Tendulkar to grace the occasion.""Already the prize money has been doubled. It feels good that some former cricketers will be coming for the event. Why can't cricketers play other sports?""If we can support other sport apart from cricket, why not? In India, there is not just one game,"" said the man, who has been an amateur golfer since his retirement.","Other teams also came to India to compete in the World Cup.

185,Australia exposed India's little chinks in World Cup final: Sanjay Manjrekar,"PM Modi consoles team India in dressing room after World Cup final loss against Australia

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer turned commentator Sanjay Manjrekar feels Australia superbly exploited 'little chinks' in India's batting line-up in the World Cup final to secure a record-extending sixth title.The absence of all-rounder Hardik Pandya highlighted a significant 'lack of depth' in India's batting during the final in Ahmedabad last Sunday.India faltered, losing half their side within the 36th over, ultimately getting to a modest 241 in the summit clash.""India felt the pressure of not having depth; you know, those little chinks in India's armour came to the fore,"" Manjrekar told Star Sports.Pandya pulled out of the tournament following a twisted ankle in India's fourth league match against Bangladesh as India were forced to ring in two changes -- Suryakumar Yadav and Mohammed Shami -- for their remaining matches.While Shami's inclusion was a big boost to the bowling attack, Suryakumar continued to have a woeful show in the ODI format. Suryakumar managed just 106 runs in seven innings at an average of 17.67 and a strike-rate of 100.95.""The batting depth wasn't there, and you saw the way KL Rahul played a bulk of the innings with the knowledge that there isn't much batting to come,” Manjrekar said without mentioning any name.""Well, India had certain limitations that they had covered beautifully throughout the tournament, with Jadeja at number 7 and their batting finishing at number 6,"" he added.Manjrekar further said the pressure of the final had a part to play in India's capitulation.""Just imagine this game was a league match between Sri Lanka and India; would India have taken that risk? Maybe yes, that is where perhaps temperament comes in, and maybe, if it was a league match, India would have played differently,"" he said.Former India allrounder Irfan Pathan said it was tough for India because the team was looking behind, absolutely looking behind to Jadeja and Suryakumar Yadav.""And when KL Rahul got out, I think that was the time when India couldn't just go ahead. I thought as soon as they knew that there was no cover, no mid-off, they could have used their feet a bit more and tried to rotate the strike and not allow guys like Travis Head to bowl those two overs crucially in between. Mitchell Marsh bowled one over as well.”Irfan said India lost to a better-planned game.""Australia was a better-planned team. The way they planned, starting from the toss, I don't think any other team could come close to that kind of planning,"" he added.","Suryakumar managed just 106 runs in seven innings at an average of 17.67 and a strike-rate of 100.95.
""The batting depth wasn't there, and you saw the way KL Rahul played a bulk of the innings with the knowledge that there isn't much batting to come,” Manjrekar said without mentioning any name.

Celebrations: The Complete Book of American Holidays

The Interpreter's One-Volume Commentary

When was Christ born?

Why was December chosen for Christmas celebration?

Even though Christmas is now known for its shopping frenzy, its original purpose is to commemorate the birth of Jesus, considered by Christians as the son of God. However, historical evidence doesn't support the idea that Jesus was actually born on December 25th, the widely celebrated date of Christmas.The birth of Jesus Christ remains a topic of intrigue and debate, especially concerning the actual month in which it occurred.Various theories emerge when exploring this historical event. One key element in the story revolves around shepherds tending to their flocks, as described in Luke 2:7-8 of the Bible. This detail, so central to the narrative, has been immortalized in Christmas songs. However, sources such asandpoint out that the weather conditions in late December would not have allowed for shepherds to be actively caring for their flocks. This indicates that Jesus might not have been born during the cold days of December but rather during a warmer season.Furthermore, the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem, prompted by the Roman census, adds another layer to the discussion. Historical analysis suggests that such a census would have more likely occurred during a time when travel was easier and more feasible, indicating that a low turnout, as expected in winter, would have been inconvenient. This aligns with the idea that Jesus was not born in December, as it would have been an improbable time for a mandatory census that required extensive travel. These details challenge the traditional notion that December is the birth month of Jesus Christ, inviting a reconsideration of the timeline surrounding this significant event in history.Determining the birth of Jesus involves tracing John the Baptist's timeline, with his conception believed to be six months before Jesus'. By this calculation, Jesus might have been born in June, as suggested by the United Church of God, pinpointing June 13 to 17 as a possible timeframe for his birth.December became the chosen time for Christmas due to its alignment with existing pagan festivities. Romans celebrated the winter solstice and the pagan festival known as Saturnalia from December 17 to 25. Saturnalia honored Saturn, the god of agriculture, and marked the beginning of a new solar cycle. Alongside this, Mithraism, a worship practice of the Persian god of light, also held significant rituals during this period. When Emperor Constantine I embraced Christianity in 312, church leaders aimed to merge pagan celebrations with Christian beliefs. They linked Jesus' birth to the winter solstice, citing a symbolic connection between the creation of the world and Jesus' conception. This strategic move sought to ease the transition to Christianity for the Roman population. The decision to celebrate Jesus' birth onDecember 25 was, in part, an attempt to bridge the gap between differing beliefs, hoping to encourage the conversion of pagans to Christianity.","December: Not the month birth month ofCelebrations: The Complete Book of American HolidaysThe Interpreter's One-Volume CommentaryWhen was Christ born?

199,5 lesser-known tidbits about Napoleon's hat,"Two-Pointed Design

Exaggerated Angle

Made by Poupard

Various Materials

Worn Tilted

In a recent auction held in Paris, a bicorne hat, famously worn by Napoleon Bonaparte during his reign as the French emperor, was sold for a staggering €1.932m (£1.69m). This particular hat is among the estimated 20 that have survived out of the 120 believed to have been owned by the renowned French military leader throughout his lifetime.Napoleon had several hats of the same style, known as bicornes.They varied in size and quality, ranging from more practical, everyday wear to ceremonial or specially crafted pieces for significant events. After Napoleon's exile, some of his hats were collected and preserved. Today, a few of them remain in museums and private collections, serving as historical artifacts. These iconic pieces have several interesting stories and facts surrounding them. Here are 5 lesser-known tidbits about Napoleon's hat .: The defining characteristic of the bicorne was its two points, one at the front and one at the back. This style was popular among military officers of the time for its practicality and distinctive appearance. The two points helped deflect rainwater away from the wearer's face and shoulders.: Napoleon's hats often had a more pronounced angle than typical bicornes. This exaggerated angle contributed to its unique and recognizable silhouette. The design also allowed for better visibility on the battlefield.: Napoleon's preferred hatter was a man named Poupard, who crafted several of his hats. Poupard was renowned for his craftsmanship and attention to detail. While specific details about Poupard's life and interactions with Napoleon might not be extensively documented, his work and reputation as a skilled hatter have been mentioned in historical records and accounts related to Napoleon's attire and accessories.: Napoleon's hats were made from various materials, including beaver fur and felt, showcasing the wealth and status of the wearer.: Napoleon often wore his hat tilted to the side, which became a part of his signature style. This distinctive way of wearing it added to his iconic image. Moreover, tilting the hat allowed Napoleon to have a clear line of sight, particularly on the battlefield. It provided better visibility, enabling him to survey the troops and surroundings more effectively. The tilted sign also carried a symbolic meaning. It was seen as a non-verbal communication of authority and confidence, portraying Napoleon's strong and decisive leadership.Napoleon's hat has been a recurring motif in art and culture, symbolizing power, authority, and historical significance. Despite Napoleon's eventual defeat and exile, his hat continues to be an enduring symbol of an era and a man whose influence on history is still studied and remembered today.","Here are 5 lesser-known tidbits about Napoleon's hat .

200,"Mount Olympus: Greece's highest mountain, steeped in legendary tales from ancient mythology","Mount Olympus in Greek mythology

The environmental ecosystem of Mount Olympus

India boasts Mount Kanchenjunga as its highest peak, and each country has its own towering summit. In Greece, that honour belongs to Mount Olympus, rising 2918 meters above sea level. Nestled between Pieria and Larissa provinces, it marks the boundary of Macedonia and Thessaly. But beyond its height and location, Mount Olympus is steeped in Greek mythology .Exploring its ties to ancient legends and how it was shaped unveils captivating tales waiting to be discovered.Created countless eons in the pastWhen observing Mount Olympus closely, you'll notice its unique microclimate. But what exactly is that? A microclimate refers to specific weather conditions different from its surrounding areas. This mountain's peculiar climate is influenced by its proximity to the sea and its elevation. Scientists believe Mount Olympus formed over 200 million years ago when layers of sedimentary rocks from the nearby shallow sea gathered, shaping its structure. Additionally, glacial movements caused geological shifts, resulting in depressions around the mountain. As temperatures rose, glaciers melted, carrying crushed rocks to the sea and leaving behind a colossal alluvial fan. This fan, resembling a cone-shaped heap of sediment, played a significant role in the formation of Mount Olympus. Over time, these natural processes sculpted this majestic peak, offering a glimpse into the intriguing geological history of this legendary mountain.In ancient Greek stories, Mount Olympus was believed to be the dwelling place of gods and goddesses. According to their tales, this mountain's summit held Zeus's throne, where the Olympians, twelve powerful gods and goddesses, resided within hidden palaces nestled amid numerous valleys. They were thought to live much like humans, engaging in activities and ruling from their respective castles atop the peak.This belief led Greek tribes to name the highest points of various areas Olympus, linking them symbolically to the mountain. Thus, peaks in places like Mysia, Laconia, Lycia, Cyprus, Attica, Euboea, Ionia, and Lesbos were all called Olympus. The ancient Greeks also revered Mount Olympus as the origin of Zeus's immense power, which they associated with supernatural forces. Interestingly, people lived only in the foothills because the mountain's higher regions were believed to be the exclusive domain of the gods and goddesses.Mount Olympus boasts diverse landscapes and a rich array of plants and animals. Its terrain supports Mediterranean shrubs and a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees like willows, alders, beeches, black pines, and vibrant red lilies. Among the unique species is the robolo or Olympus pine, creating lush sub-alpine meadows. Various flowers thrive here too, such as daphne, buxus, juniperus, astragalus, and berberis.The region hosts nine to ten woodpecker species, horned larks, alpine accentors, golden eagles, short-toed snake eagles, European honey buzzards, and the rare wallcreeper. Additionally, it's a haven for over 170 butterfly species. This diverse ecosystem in Mount Olympus provides a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna, making it a fascinating and biodiverse area to explore.","Mount Olympus in Greek mythologyThe environmental ecosystem of Mount OlympusIndia boasts Mount Kanchenjunga as its highest peak, and each country has its own towering summit.

ace Organic Chemistry in JEE

Main 2024

Master the Mechanisms

READ ALSO:

Improve your Problem-Solving Skills

Get Familiar with Reaction Intermediates

Embrace Visual Aids

READ ALSO:

Group Study and Discussions

Students preparing for the Joint Entrance Examination (Mains) often find organic chemistry tricky and challenging. In general, students rate chemistry as the easiest of the three: Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry. However, a large section of the students struggle in this section.: Organic Chemistry focuses on understanding how electrons move and rearrange during reactions.Instead of just memorising reaction equations, explore the mechanisms that drive them. Figure out the electron movements, recognise important intermediates, and grasp the forces guiding each step. This thorough comprehension will help you to handle new challenges and forecast reaction results.: The key to success is practice! Work on solving different problems, including multiple-choice questions and numerical ones, that encompass various reactions and functional groups. Concentrate on problems that require applying your understanding of mechanisms and their application in multi-step synthesis. Take advantage of previous JEE papers and practice tests to become acquainted with the exam structure and pinpoint areas where you excel or need improvement.: In organic reactions, carbocations and carbanions play a crucial role but they are often overlooked. Knowing how they form, their stability, and how they react will provide you with a significant advantage. Develop the skill to identify them in reaction processes and foresee how they influence the final products.: Understanding organic molecules and their changes can be tricky when approached abstractly. Make it easier by using flashcards with clearly labelled structures, drawing reaction arrows on whiteboards, and forming mind maps to link various concepts. Seeing the processes visually will strengthen your comprehension and improve your memory recall.: Engaging in study sessions and talking about concepts with your classmates can be really helpful. Share your study materials, clarify complex mechanisms to one another, and quiz each other's understanding. This teamwork in learning will boost your confidence and expose you to different viewpoints.Keep in mind that Organic Chemistry isn't just about rote memorisation; it's about gaining a profound grasp of the core principles and using them to tackle problems. Summarise essential ideas, emphasise crucial reactions, and create a glossary of important terms. This well-organised study material will serve as your handy reference for swift review and last-minute studying.","Here are 5 tips toace Organic Chemistry in JEEMain 2024Master the MechanismsREAD ALSO:Improve your Problem-Solving SkillsGet Familiar with Reaction IntermediatesEmbrace Visual AidsREAD ALSO:Group Study and DiscussionsStudents preparing for the Joint Entrance Examination (Mains) often find organic chemistry tricky and challenging.

231,Think you're good at observing? Find all the differences in this panda puzzle under 30 seconds,"What are the differences?

A variance in one of its ears.

Inconsistency in the size of the panda's mouth.

Absence of a belly button in one photo.

Discrepancy in the number of leaves, with one photo displaying four while the other has three.

Difference observed in the panda's foot.

Take your time: patience is key. carefully examine each detail without rushing, ensuring you don't miss anything.

Focus on patterns: look for patterns or repetitions. sometimes, differences hide within repeated elements.

Start with the big picture: begin by observing the overall scene before diving into specific details. this helps in understanding the context.

Segment the image: break down the image into smaller sections. this makes it easier to spot differences without feeling overwhelmed.

Compare side by side: place the images side by side for a direct comparison. it enhances your ability to identify variations.

Spot the difference puzzles, popular on the internet for their difficulty, create a buzz on social media. Especially for panda lovers, this picture puzzle is heartwarming. The key is sharp observation, focusing on every detail. Missing even small elements can make finding the answer challenging.While the images may initially seem similar, it's crucial to note that there are indeed five distinctions between them.What makes this brain teaser a bit more manageable is its monochromatic color scheme and the simplicity of the background settings. As you tackle such a puzzle, factors like size, colors, and the overall nature of the image must be taken into careful consideration.The use of black and white accents, coupled with a clear setting, serves to streamline the number of elements demanding concentration. However, it's worth mentioning that for some solvers, the monochrome features themselves might pose a challenge in terms of focus. A helpful strategy is to start by dividing the images into multiple sections and focusing on each segment individually. This approach, breaking down the larger image into smaller, more manageable parts, aids in observing minute details, rather than attempting to analyze the entire image as a whole. This method proves effective in enhancing the solver's ability to discern subtle differences within the puzzle.How many differences were you able to spot?Here's a few simple ways to improve yourself in these observation puzzles","Segment the image: break down the image into smaller sections.

242,The Misguided War on the SAT,"'Picking Up Fundamentals'

A Fixed Benchmark

The View From MIT

A Question of Values

This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

After the COVID pandemic made it difficult for high school students to take the SAT and ACT, dozens of selective colleges dropped their requirement that applicants do so. Colleges described the move as temporary, but nearly all have since stuck to a test-optional policy . It reflects a backlash against standardized tests that began long before the pandemic, and many people have hailed the change as a victory for equity in higher education .Now, though, a growing number of experts and university administrators wonder whether the switch has been a mistake. Research has increasingly shown that standardized test scores contain real information, helping to predict college grades , chances of graduation and post-college success. Test scores are more reliable than high school grades, partly because of grade inflation in recent years.Without test scores, admissions officers sometimes have a hard time distinguishing between applicants who are likely to do well at elite colleges and those who are likely to struggle. Researchers who have studied the issue say that test scores can be particularly helpful in identifying lower-income students and underrepresented minorities who will thrive. These students do not score as high on average as students from affluent communities or white and Asian students. But a solid score for a student from a less privileged background is often a sign of enormous potential.""Standardized test scores are a much better predictor of academic success than high school grades,"" Christina Paxson, the president of Brown University , recently wrote. Stuart Schmill -- the dean of admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the few schools to have reinstated its test requirement -- said, ""Just getting straight A's is not enough information for us to know whether the students are going to succeed or not.""An academic study released in the summer by the group Opportunity Insights, covering the so-called Ivy Plus colleges (the eight in the Ivy League, along with Duke, MIT, Stanford and the University of Chicago), showed little relationship between high school grade-point average and success in college. The researchers found a strong relationship between test scores and later success.Likewise, a faculty committee at the University of California system -- led by Dr. Henry Sánchez, a pathologist, and Eddie Comeaux, a professor of education -- concluded in 2020 that test scores were better than high school grades at predicting student success in the system's nine colleges, where more than 230,000 undergraduates are enrolled. The relative advantage of test scores has grown over time, the committee found.""Test scores have vastly more predictive power than is commonly understood in the popular debate,"" said John Friedman, an economics professor at Brown and one of the authors of the Ivy Plus admissions study.With the Supreme Court's restriction of affirmative action last year, emotions around college admissions are running high. The debate over standardized testing has become caught up in deeper questions about inequality in America and what purpose, ultimately, the nation's universities should serve.But the data suggests that testing critics have drawn the wrong battle lines. If test scores are used as one factor among others -- and if colleges give applicants credit for having overcome adversity -- the SAT and ACT can help create diverse classes of highly talented students. Restoring the tests might also help address a different frustration that many Americans have with the admissions process at elite universities: that it has become too opaque and unconnected to merit.Given the data, why haven't colleges reinstated their test requirements?For one thing, standardized tests are easy to dislike. They create stress for millions of teenagers. The tests seem to reduce the talent and potential of a human being to a single number. The SAT's original name, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, implied a rigor that even its current defenders would not claim. COVID, in short, created an opportunity for American society to cast off a tradition that few people enjoyed.But another part of the explanation involves politics. Standardized tests have become especially unpopular among political progressives, and university campuses are dominated by progressives.Many consider the tests to be unfair because there are score gaps by race and class. Average scores for modest-income, Black and Hispanic students are lower than those for white, Asian and upper-income students. The tests' critics worry that reinstating test requirements will reduce diversity. The Supreme Court's affirmative action decision has heightened these concerns.If selective colleges made admissions decisions based solely on test scores, racial and economic diversity would indeed plummet. Yet almost nobody in higher education favors using tests as the main factor for admissions. The question instead is whether the scores should be one of the criteria used to identify qualified students from every demographic group.The SAT's history offers some complex perspective. As the test's critics sometimes point out, one designer of the original standardized tests in the early 20th century, Carl Brigham, also wrote a book promoting racist theories of intelligence (which he later disavowed). But a larger rationale for tests was connected to an expansion of opportunity. Administrators at Harvard, who pushed for the creation of the tests, saw them as a way to identify talented students from any background. The administrators believed that these students would go on to strengthen the country's elite institutions, which were dominated by a narrow group of white Protestants, as Nicholas Lemann explained in ""The Big Test,"" his history of the SAT.Today, perhaps the strongest argument in favour of the tests is that other parts of the admissions process have even larger racial and economic biases. Affluent students can participate in expensive activities, like music lessons and travel sports teams, that strengthen their applications. These same students often receive extensive editing on their essays from their well-educated parents. Many affluent students attend private schools where counsellors polish each student's application.The tests are not entirely objective, of course. Well-off students can pay for test prep classes and can pay to take the tests multiple times. Yet the evidence suggests that these advantages cause a very small part of the gaps.Consider that other measures of learning -- like the NAEP, a test that elementary and middle school students take nationwide -- show similarly large racial and economic gaps. The federal government describes the NAEP as ""the nation's report card,"" while education researchers consider it a rigorous measure of K-12 learning. And even though students do not take NAEP test prep classes, its demographic gaps look remarkably similar to those of the ACT and SAT.This similarity ""is another piece of evidence that the SAT is picking up fundamentals,"" said Raj Chetty, a Harvard economics professor who conducted the recent Ivy Plus study with Friedman and David Deming. ""It strengthens the argument that the disparities in SAT scores are a symptom, not a cause, of inequality in the U.S.,"" Chetty said.To put it another way, the existence of racial and economic gaps in SAT and ACT scores doesn't prove that the tests are biased. After all, most measures of life in America -- on income, life expectancy, homeownership and more -- show gaps. No wonder: Our society suffers from huge inequities. The problem isn't generally with the statistics, however. The relatively high Black poverty rate is not a sign that the statistic is biased. Nor would scrapping the statistic alleviate poverty.The data documenting the predictive power of standardized tests is extensive and growing. In the study of Ivy Plus colleges, Chetty, Deming and Friedman looked at several measures of college success, such as whether students did well enough to earn admission to a top graduate school or be hired by a desirable company. Standardized test scores were a good predictor. High school grades were much less so.Last week, three scholars -- Bruce Sacerdote and Michele Tine of Dartmouth, along with Friedman -- released additional research about some unnamed Ivy Plus colleges. It showed only a modest relationship between high school grades and college grades, partly because so many high school students now receive A's. The relationship between test scores and college grades, by contrast, was strong. Students who did not submit a test score tended to struggle as much as those who had lower scores.Some people have worried that SAT scores are merely a proxy for income or race, Sacerdote noted, but the data should alleviate this concern. Within every racial group, students with higher scores do better in college. The same is true among poor students and among richer students.Amid all the subjectivity in the admissions process, the SAT and ACT -- even with their flaws -- offer meaningful information about an applicant's readiness to do high-level academic work. The tests create a fixed benchmark that can be more reliable than high school grades, teacher recommendations or extracurricular activities. ""The SAT just tells you a lot about how well prepared students are for college,"" Sacerdote said.When I have asked university administrators whether they were aware of the research showing the value of test scores, they have generally said they were. But several told me, not for quotation, that they feared the political reaction on their campuses and in the media if they reinstated tests. ""It's not politically correct,"" Charles Deacon, the longtime admissions dean at Georgetown University, which does require test scores, has told journalist Jeffrey Selingo.In 2020, the University of California system went further than most colleges and announced -- despite its own data showing the predictive value of tests -- that it would no longer accept test scores even from applicants who wanted to submit them. In recent months, I made multiple requests to discuss the policy with university officials. They replied with an emailed statement saying that ""U.C. remains committed to maintaining a fair admissions process that reviews every applicant in a comprehensive manner and endeavors to combat systemic inequities."" University spokespeople declined to discuss the policy by telephone or to schedule an interview with an administrator.It remains unclear whether other colleges will revisit their test-optional policies given the new data. As is, many teenagers say they are confused. They are uncertain about whether to take the tests and what scores are high enough to submit.MIT has become a case study in how to require standardized tests while prioritizing diversity, according to professors elsewhere who wish their own schools would follow its lead. During the pandemic, MIT suspended its test requirement for two years. But after officials there studied the previous 15 years of admissions records, they found that students who had been accepted despite lower test scores were more likely to struggle or drop out.Schmill, the admissions dean, emphasizes that the scores are not the main factor that the college now uses. Still, he and his colleagues find the scores useful in identifying promising applicants who come from less advantaged high schools and have scores high enough to suggest they would succeed at MIT.Without test scores, Schmill explained, admissions officers were left with two unappealing options. They would have to guess which students were likely to do well at MIT -- and almost certainly guess wrong sometimes, rejecting qualified applicants while admitting weaker ones. Or MIT would need to reject more students from less advantaged high schools and admit more from the private schools and advantaged public schools that have a strong record of producing well-qualified students.""Once we brought the test requirement back, we admitted the most diverse class that we ever had in our history,"" Schmill said. ""Having test scores was helpful."" In MIT's current first-year class, 15% of students are Black, 16% are Hispanic, 38% are white, and 40% are Asian American. About 20% receive Pell Grants, the federal program for lower-income students. That share is higher than at many other elite schools.""When you don't have test scores, the students who suffer most are those with high grades at relatively unknown high schools, the kind that rarely send kids to the Ivy League,"" said Deming, a Harvard economist. ""The SAT is their lifeline.""Other colleges that still require the ACT or SAT tend to be somewhat removed from the intensely liberal culture of most elite campuses. Applicants to the United States Military Academy, at West Point, must take one of the tests. So must applicants to top public universities in Florida, Georgia and Tennessee. Gallaudet, a university in Washington, D.C., for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, also requires a test score.The strongest case against the tests comes from educational reformers who want to rethink elite higher education in fundamental ways. To them, the country's top colleges should not be trying to identify the very best high school students; instead, these colleges should use their resources to educate a diverse mix of good students and, in the process, lift social mobility.Comeaux -- a professor of higher education at the University of California, Riverside, and co-chair of the state's review of standardized tests -- favors this approach. He agrees that the SAT and ACT predict later success. But he prefers a stripped-down admissions system in which colleges set minimum requirements, based largely on high school grades, and then admit students by lottery. ""Having a lottery,"" Comeaux said, ""would make us radically rethink what it means to gain access and also to learn, rather than accepting the status quo.""That's not so different from what many colleges already do. The average acceptance rate nationwide is close to 70%. Even many selective colleges admit more than 25% of applicants, and high school grades can be sufficient for that purpose. ""Test scores become relatively more important as the academic level of students increases,"" Friedman said.The SAT debate really comes down to dozens of elite colleges, like Harvard, MIT, Williams, Carleton, UCLA and the University of Michigan. The people who run these institutions agree that social mobility should be core to their mission, which is why they give applicants credit for having overcome adversity. But the colleges have another mission, as well: excellence.They want to identify and educate the students most likely to excel. These students, in turn, can produce cutting-edge scientific research that will cure diseases and accelerate the world's transition to clean energy. The students can found nonprofit groups and companies that benefit all of society.Administrators at elite colleges have justified their decision to stop requiring test scores by claiming that the tests do not help them identify such promising students -- a claim that is inconsistent with the evidence. The evidence instead suggests that standardized tests can contribute to both excellence and diversity so long as they are used as only one factor in admissions.As it happens, most Americans support using standardized test scores in precisely this way. The Pew Research Center has asked Americans whether colleges should consider standardized tests when making admissions decisions. A large majority of people, across racial groups, support doing so.In today's politically polarized country, however, the notion that standardized tests are worthless or counterproductive has become a tenet of liberalism. It has also become an example of how polarization can cause Americans to adopt positions that are not based on empirical evidence.Conservatives do it on many issues, including the dangers of climate change, the effectiveness of COVID vaccines and the safety of abortion pills. But liberals sometimes try to wish away inconvenient facts, too. In recent years, Americans on the left have been reluctant to acknowledge that extended COVID school closures were a mistake, that policing can reduce crime and that drug legalization can damage public health.There is a common thread to these examples. Intuitively, the progressive position sounds as if it should reduce inequities. But data has suggested that some of these policies may do the opposite, harming vulnerable people.In the case of standardized tests, those people are the lower-income, Black and Hispanic students who would have done well on the ACT or SAT but who never took the test because they didn't have to. Many colleges have effectively tried to protect these students from standardized tests. In the process, the colleges denied some of them an opportunity to change their lives -- and change society -- for the better.","Research has increasingly shown that standardized test scores contain real information, helping to predict college grades , chances of graduation and post-college success.
The relative advantage of test scores has grown over time, the committee found.
Nor would scrapping the statistic alleviate poverty.The data documenting the predictive power of standardized tests is extensive and growing.
Standardized test scores were a good predictor.
It showed only a modest relationship between high school grades and college grades, partly because so many high school students now receive A's.","['colleges', 'high', 'scores', 'school', 'university', 'admissions', 'misguided', 'test', 'war', 'students', 'tests', 'standardized']"

245,Want to study in the US with scholarship? Crack GRE with these tips,"Clearing a globally recognized assessment test is an integral part of a student’s journey to pursue higher education in an overseas university of his/her choice. One of the key exams for pursuing higher education in the US is the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), conducted by ETS. The GRE is the world’s most widely used test for securing admission to leading graduate and professional schools in the world.In India, the number of GRE test-takers has surged impressively, rising from approximately 66,000 in 2020-21 to 1.11 lakhs in 2021-22 – marking a notable 68% increase.With the changes made to the GRE in September 2023, the test has been further revised to make the assessment process more convenient for test takers. The most important change was the reduction in test duration to under two hours from about four hours, which has made it easier for students to test their skills in a reduced duration, making it the shortest assessment for admissions to graduate and professional exams globally.Students also stand to benefit from the Best Score reporting under GRE, which allows them the flexibility to submit their best scores achieved across multiple tests and offers a slight edge with official scores being reported in 8-10 calendar days, a tad faster than the 10-15 calendar days of the old GRE. This allows candidates to plan their abroad application effectively.Being Section level adaptive, with no negative marking and its test scores remaining valid for a period of five years, the GRE offers students an opportunity to enhance their prospects for securing admission in leading overseas universities, across multiple streams, including STEM, MBA, Humanities and Law.More and more students, now, are looking for professional certification of cognitive skills, which are factored in by leading global organizations. GRE offers an advantage to students as it is the only globally recognized test which measures a candidate’s cognitive skills objectively.Here are some valuable tips to help you crack the GRE and enhance your chances of securing a scholarship.• Understand the GRE Format: The GRE consists of three main sections – Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing.

Consistent and focused study sessions are key to mastering the content.• Use Official GRE Materials: ETS, the organization that administers the GRE, provides official study materials that closely resemble the actual test. Utilize these resources to familiarize yourself with the question formats and types. The Official Guide to the GRE and PowerPrep software are valuable tools for practice.• Take Practice Tests: Regularly take full-length practice tests to simulate the actual GRE environment. This not only helps in understanding the time constraints but also identifies areas where improvement is needed. Analyze your performance to refine your study plan.• Improve Time Management: Time management is crucial during the GRE. Practice answering questions within the allotted time for each section. Develop strategies to quickly identify and tackle different question types without compromising accuracy.• Enhance Vocabulary and Mathematical Skills: The Verbal and Quantitative sections heavily rely on a strong vocabulary and solid mathematical skills. Expand your vocabulary by reading extensively, and practice mathematical concepts regularly. Flashcards can be a useful tool for learning and reinforcing new words.• Work on Writing Skills: The Analytical Writing section assesses your ability to articulate complex ideas and present them coherently. Practice writing essays on diverse topics and seek feedback to enhance your writing skills. Focus on constructing clear arguments and supporting them with relevant examples.• Seek Professional Guidance: Consider enrolling in GRE preparation courses or hiring a tutor if you need personalized guidance.

10) Not seeking help when you need it

The JEE Advanced 2024 , scheduled for May 26, 2024, demands dedicated preparation, especially for those who qualify among the top 2,50,000 ranks in the JEE Main 2024 exam. Success in both JEE Main and JEE Advanced is imperative for securing a coveted spot in the prestigious IITs. As the journey to secure a seat in an IIT requires meticulous planning, candidates must steer clear of common pitfalls.The JEE Advanced is a very competitive exam, and it is important to start your preparation early enough to give yourself enough time to cover the vast amount of material that is tested. Aim to start your preparation at least a year before the exam.Developing a well-organized study plan is paramount for JEE Advanced preparation. Candidates, especially those transitioning from JEE Main, should establish a clear study schedule to cover the syllabus effectively and avoid last-minute rushes.Ignoring the official JEE Advanced syllabus is a prevalent mistake. Candidates must align their preparation with the prescribed syllabus provided by the National Testing Agency and IITs. Understanding the exam pattern is equally crucial for effective preparation.While memorization is important, it is not enough to succeed in the JEE Advanced. You need to understand the concepts behind the formulas and equations in order to apply them correctly to solve problems.The only way to improve your problem-solving skills is to practice regularly. Solve as many problems as you can from the previous year's question papers and practice tests.Underestimating the importance of the Chemistry section is a significant error. Despite some students finding it less engaging, a well-prepared Chemistry section can contribute to scoring well. Devoting ample time to this section can be advantageous.Overlooking NCERT books is a common oversight. These books serve as foundational study material, aligning with the official syllabus. Many direct questions in JEE Advanced have been observed to come from NCERT books in previous years.Overconfidence in tackling complex questions without considering negative markings is a critical mistake. Smart question selection, careful evaluation of potential answers, and strategic skipping when uncertain can help avoid unnecessary loss of marks.Your health is important for your studies. Make sure to eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly.Don't be afraid to ask for help if you are struggling with a particular concept or topic. There are many resources available, such as teachers, tutors, and online forums.","Here are 10 critical mistakes to avoid during JEE Advanced 2024 preparation:1) Not starting your preparation early enough2) Lack of a ProperStudy Plan3) Unfamiliarity with theOfficial SyllabusREAD ALSO:4) Focusing only on memorizing concepts5) Not practicing enough6) Neglecting the Chemistry Section7) Not Referring to NCERT Books8) DisregardingNegative Marking9) Not taking care of your health10) Not seeking help when you need itThe JEE Advanced 2024 , scheduled for May 26, 2024, demands dedicated preparation, especially for those who qualify among the top 2,50,000 ranks in the JEE Main 2024 exam.

273,Edtech: Ways in which AI can lead to disruption of the EdTech sector,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the buzzword today in the digital technological domain. AI, the intelligence that can be exhibited by machines, performs various tasks by perceiving minutely its environment and taking actions that enhance the possibilities of achieving the required goals. These attributes can be of great help in the education sector too and have huge potential to disrupt the already existing EdTech tools.

Automation

of routine activities performed by teacher:

Currently, teachers have to spend an enormous amount of time evaluating and assessing homework, assignments and exam papers

A.I. can be extremely useful at this point by automating such activities and giving productive tips and inputs to the educator to ease their tasks

It can act as a virtual live-assistant for the teachers and provide real-time input to for choosing the right approach for the students

This will provide teachers with much more time to devote to teaching, clearing doubts and simplifying concepts and helping out students

Customised solutions for every student:

Lack of personalised attention and approach has always been a persisting problem in a huge class as it's time-consuming and impractical for any teacher

AI’s high processing power can prove to be a boon in such a scenario and adjust the learning needs of the students by building student profiles, reading expressions and modifying ongoing lessons accordingly

It can further help in recognising and differentiating the weaknesses and strengths of the students by the following features:

By synchronising to an individual's level of knowledge and pace of learning

By adapting to other details like goals and learning histories of the students

Approaching studies with such AI-based customised solutions can enable children to follow a learning path that suits them best rather than trying to fit in others’ shoes

Provide a self-learning platform:

AI can increase the engagement and interest of the students in their studies and the learning process by acquainting them accurately with their learning parameters

It can make them self-aware and increase motivation in learning and encourage them to carry out learning even in the absence or less involvement of the educators

This can ensure in the long term lesser dropout rates

Instrumental for physically-different students:

AI research is being carried out for providing communication solutions through chatbots, real-time language translation apps and plug-ins for the hearing impaired and those facing issues in language

Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the buzzword today in the digital technological domain. AI, the intelligence that can be exhibited by machines, performs various tasks by perceiving minutely its environment and taking actions that enhance the possibilities of achieving the required goals. These attributes can be of great help in the education sector too and have huge potential to disrupt the already existing EdTech tools.It will reorient and transform the way students and teachers have been operating in the learning process. A research market engine has even predicted the use of A.I. to grow annually in education by 45%.A look at the major ways in which AI can disrupt the existing EdTech sector :The AI’s potential for disruption can be evinced by the fact that this technology is designed and created to perform reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. In everyday life AI is popularly used in the form of voice assistant, image recognition and face unlock inAndroid phones, natural language processing and ML-based financial fraud detection. Currently, research is also being conducted on improving student-teacher compatibility or improving the understanding between teachers and students.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the buzzword today in the digital technological domain.

274,How useful is Artificial Intelligence in learning and teaching?,"Provides personalised and differentiated learning interface

Convenient tutoring and additional support

A global educational access

Timely feedback and correction

In the world of technology, one of the greatest inventions that has blown people’s minds is the genius of artificial intelligence (AI). A unique software invention, AI picks up stimulation from human intelligence and mimics it through machines. The programs generated through artificial intelligence produce real human-interested actions as they tend to think like humans.With this ultimate prowess and the ability to behave like humans, the inclusion of AI has seeped deep into our daily lives. The presence of AI has become inevitable, right from taking pictures to automated parking directions in the car, data analysis in business to the innovation of medicine. And now the benefits of AI have trickled into the field of education, making learning joyous. Right from making the most complex of subjects easy, to helping teachers with automatic grading and attendance, the integration of artificial intelligence has taken the understanding of education into the future and beyond. Here is how AI is making itself useful in learning and teaching In education, the convenience of artificial intelligence ensures custom-made study materials depending on a student’s needs. The educational software in artificial intelligence is capable of making adaptive learning technology, games, and programs for students that enhance the process of knowledge acquisition. The benefit of such a system lies in the simple fact that it ends up highlighting a student’s individualised needs around specific subject topics where they might feel stuck. This entire process, at the end of the day, also makes teaching less complicated, giving tutors the freedom to offer support to the students when in need.With AI-integrated courses and study materials, it leaves abundant time for the teachers to provide more attention to students individually. With AI, organisational and administrative tasks such as attendance counting, assembling resource materials, filling progress reports, evaluating homework, and grading tests can be automated, making the world more quick and efficient. In the current scenario, AI has reached the level of grading multiple-choice tests, but soon it will be able to grade written responses as well. In fact, there are already a few artificial intelligence-based tutoring programs that can teach basic mathematics, writing, and other subjects. These benefits of AI leave a huge space open for teachers to spend quality time with each student.Another major benefit of an artificial intelligence-based learning system is that it makes access to educational resources easy across borders. Through AI tools, learning becomes attainable for students with hearing and visual impairments, as well as for those coming from different language backgrounds. Software under AI provides students with real-time subtitles for everything the teacher is saying in the class. This urges the student to continue learning the subject further, which opens up new possibilities for them. At the same time, it offers knowledge and learning on subjects that otherwise might not be available in schools for the students.As AI technology provides consolidated study and course materials to students across the world, it also helps gain quick feedback. Being able to customise the needs of a student also allows for an immediate response to the functionality. Apart from tutoring students, the AI systems also assist teachers in identifying specific areas for improvement.The road to the future of education from here only leads to stress-free learning and teaching. Learning through artificial intelligence based on individual needs and understanding aids in enhanced performance.","Provides personalised and differentiated learning interfaceConvenient tutoring and additional supportA global educational accessTimely feedback and correctionIn the world of technology, one of the greatest inventions that has blown people’s minds is the genius of artificial intelligence (AI).

275,What is UNESCO’s 10-plan strategy for distance learning solutions?,"Ensuring

digital

preparedness and choosing the most relevant tools:

The educational institutes should zero in on the right technology, whether high-end or acreage depending on the local internet connectivity, power supply, and digital skills of teachers and students

This would include integrated video lessons, digital learning platforms, and Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) for broadcasting through radios and TVs

Inclusiveness in distance learning programmes:

Distance learning programmes should ensure the inclusion and access of students with disabilities, special needs, and the ones from marginalised sections

The devices can be temporarily decentralised from computer labs to families to ensure internet connectivity in case of limited devices

Ensuring data security and privacy:

Data security should be assessed properly while uploading and sharing educational content on the learning apps, with students and other organisations

It should be ensured that the use of these applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacy

Planned study schedule:

Study schedules should be planned to keep in mind the interests, availability of parents, school closure, and total duration of schools

Furthermore, the situation of the affected zones in times of crisis, the level of studies, and the needs of students should also be considered

Training the educators and parents in using digital tools:

Brief training sessions should be organised for teachers and parents to help them monitor their children when needed

Teachers should be trained for doing basic settings, using internet data, live streaming lessons, etc

Blending learning approaches :

The tools that are commonly available for the majority of students for both synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning

Teachers should limit the usage of applications and platforms, and not burden parents and students with downloading many educational apps

Developing and defining distance learning rules:

The rules for distance learning courses should be developed and defined after discussing them with parents and students on distance learning

The methodology should include formative questions, tests, and exercises to closely monitor the learning process of students

Tools that support the submission of students’ feedback should be used instead of asking parents to scan and send the feedback

Fixing the duration of distance learning units based on students’ self-regulation skills:

A practically viable timing should be set according to the cognitive abilities and self-regulation of the students

The learning units should be recommended to be not more than 20 minutes, and not more than 40 minutes for secondary school students

Create communities and enhance connection:

To address the issues of isolation, helplessness, and anxiety among both children and parents, communities of teachers, parents, and school managers should be created

Parents should be encouraged to share their experiences in coping with distance learning strategies and facing learning difficulties

The onset of the pandemic brought many changes in the mode of education for schools and colleges. This led many international organisations, private sectors, and government agencies to ensure the continuity of education remotely. However, the design and delivery of distance learning should also reach everyone irrespective of social inequalities. UNESCO published in April 2020, a comprehensive 10-plan guideline and strategy for effective distance learning.Some of the important guidelines in this 10-plan strategy are the following:Currently, many governmental agencies are working with global and private organisations and civil society to impart education remotely by combining various technologies.","Ensuringdigitalpreparedness and choosing the most relevant tools:The educational institutes should zero in on the right technology, whether high-end or acreage depending on the local internet connectivity, power supply, and digital skills of teachers and studentsThis would include integrated video lessons, digital learning platforms, and Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) for broadcasting through radios and TVsInclusiveness in distance learning programmes:Distance learning programmes should ensure the inclusion and access of students with disabilities, special needs, and the ones from marginalised sectionsThe devices can be temporarily decentralised from computer labs to families to ensure internet connectivity in case of limited devicesEnsuring data security and privacy:Data security should be assessed properly while uploading and sharing educational content on the learning apps, with students and other organisationsIt should be ensured that the use of these applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacyPlanned study schedule:Study schedules should be planned to keep in mind the interests, availability of parents, school closure, and total duration of schoolsFurthermore, the situation of the affected zones in times of crisis, the level of studies, and the needs of students should also be consideredTraining the educators and parents in using digital tools:Brief training sessions should be organised for teachers and parents to help them monitor their children when neededTeachers should be trained for doing basic settings, using internet data, live streaming lessons, etcBlending learning approaches :The tools that are commonly available for the majority of students for both synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learningTeachers should limit the usage of applications and platforms, and not burden parents and students with downloading many educational appsDeveloping and defining distance learning rules:The rules for distance learning courses should be developed and defined after discussing them with parents and students on distance learningThe methodology should include formative questions, tests, and exercises to closely monitor the learning process of studentsTools that support the submission of students’ feedback should be used instead of asking parents to scan and send the feedbackFixing the duration of distance learning units based on students’ self-regulation skills:A practically viable timing should be set according to the cognitive abilities and self-regulation of the studentsThe learning units should be recommended to be not more than 20 minutes, and not more than 40 minutes for secondary school studentsCreate communities and enhance connection:To address the issues of isolation, helplessness, and anxiety among both children and parents, communities of teachers, parents, and school managers should be createdParents should be encouraged to share their experiences in coping with distance learning strategies and facing learning difficultiesThe onset of the pandemic brought many changes in the mode of education for schools and colleges.

5. Presentations

6. Forum post Discussions

Student assessment is a good progress indicator and with E-learning a prevalent medium, teachers need to know and check the process of assessment. It is an essential part of effective teaching too in an online learning atmosphere. Assessment evaluates and improves learning by challenging students to look back on what is learned; it also helps to apply knowledge to answer and solve problems.Now that online learning is a standard learning method, it is important to know the evaluation approaches. Different approaches are designed to assess children online; the ultimate goal is to see where the child stands from an academic point of view and how many lessons are retained.The two major approaches of assessment include formative and summative assessment. Formative assessment judges strengths and weaknesses. For every lesson, the feedback received helps to improve the teaching process. Whereas in the summative assessment, the approach is to test the retention after the lessons are taught and improvements are made. this is in a way a test of the instruction materialLet’s see the top 5 ways to assess a child during E-learning:Quizzing is the simplest form of assessment. This determines the engagement of the child. Multiple choice and gap-filling are the easiest forms. Quizzes can be designed time-based. With the online facility, the set of questions can be made unique. Overall, it is easy to create and analyse the result. Further, with unique question sets, cheating is preventedEssay writing or open-ended questions are good assessors and a good opportunity for students to organise their thoughts and opinions. The students are encouraged to create a comprehensive answer and test what is learned. A child’s critical thinking is also checked through open-ended questions.Polls are easy-to-get answers or feedback about students' learning experiences. Students are asked to give opinions about the lessons or courses, their interests and dislikes. Digital platforms provide easy methods to write questions in the form.A session of real-life conversations is a great way to improve communication skills. Students learn conversations with peers, customers and colleagues. Learners are challenged in real-time situations such as concept presentation, application of a theory, selling a product, or assigning or managing a task. This way, they learn to prepare for an interview that they might face in the near future. The way the students handle the conversation, prepares them to reflect on their problem-solving skills.Students themselves creating and presenting the concepts or explaining topics is a good way to learn a topic and make others learn the same. Students presenting explain the whole class, and receive feedback from their peers and the teachers. Web conferencing tools provide great facilities for this.Forum post assessments include sharing everyone's opinions to understand, favour or argue the points of the classmates. Discussion topics for students can be created along with guidelines to answer. This way, the level of understanding and participation can be checked.Assessment is always required to check how far the path has been covered and how good the journey has been. Just as traditional schooling, e-learning has some great methods to assess students and rate their performance and growth. To keep the child's growth in check and to help in their overall development, assessment during E-learning is very important.","Forum post DiscussionsStudent assessment is a good progress indicator and with E-learning a prevalent medium, teachers need to know and check the process of assessment.

In this method, both computer algorithms and artificial intelligence are used to conduct interaction with the learner and deliver customised resources and learning activities according to the varying needs of the learners Individualised learning : This method involves orienting content, instructional technology, and pace of learning according to the abilities and interests of each learner

This method involves orienting content, instructional technology, and pace of learning according to the abilities and interests of each learner Competency-based learning: This learning approach focuses on the progress of the students at their own pace and level of knowledge

Learning through online platforms:

ML algorithms help to analyse the online course content, identify whether the information is relevant to the current standards, and analyse if the learners can understand what they learn

This is done by asking students to answer some questions that help to get fair knowledge about their interests, pace of understanding, and level of knowledge

This in turn helps to design customised courses and relevant materials on demand

All-round mobile learning :

ML-enabled educational apps have made it possible to access educational content whenever one wants and have enabled 24x7 mobile learning

These apps use various parameters and learning behaviour to increase the engagement of students and improve their overall learning experience by personalising the content

Duolingo is an app that uses ML to predict the probability of remembering certain words or phrases. When the app detects that the user frequently misses these words or phrases, it recommends practising them until they become proficient

Advanced grading:

Evaluation is an important part of any learning and ML helps achieve this by allowing teachers to identify those who need attention and detect the weak areas of the learners

The progress monitoring ML tools help track the growth and evaluate lessons in an individual-centric way to find out the solution that works best for the student

The University of California at Berkeley has created an evaluation tool, Gradescope , which evaluates and grades the student's work in some courses

, which evaluates and grades the student's work in some courses Using this tool, the teachers can know about the actual level of students' knowledge by first setting the assessment parameters and by adjusting multiple settings for each course

278,Applications of the metaverse in imparting education in schools,"Enhancing and transforming students the experience of the internet:

The schools can use metaverse to take students on n realistic field trips to prominent places in both present and historical ways

This will help make the field trips extremely engaging and enhance the experience of the students manifold

The students can also select the items and interact with historical events and visit the battlefield of a particular war and watch it as a spectator or become one of the characters

Such an approach and experience can give a way to a deeper level of learning than just reading books

Metaverse ensures thus learning engagingly in a safer environment

Connecting students around the world easily:

Metaverse can be employed to connect students from across the globe

This can be achieved by using metaverse as a tool for live translations of foreign languages for the diverse group of students, thus making it easier for them to communicate and converse

Metaverse can help in expanding the capabilities of AI and the interactive element in it can help to break down the barriers of language, culture, and locations

This can help the students to gain the desired knowledge directly and help satisfy their imagination and inquisitiveness

For explaining concepts vividly:

The immersive learning environment of the metaverse makes it achievable to present scientific concepts in a real-time manner

For instance, with the help of the metaverse, one can walk through the solar system, experience the movement of heavenly bodies or closely watch the principle behind launching rockets

The real movements of the objects in a real scenario in a 3D virtual environment help in grabbing the minutest of details and steps behind a process

Students can also practice a certain skill or experiment like dissecting frogs in the lab or doing astrophysics experiments

Virtual campus activities:

The students can participate in ongoing real events, competitions, and educational clubs through the virtual environment of the metaverse

It makes one feel like being physically present on campus and helps one to not miss any important happening because of not being physically available

281,Schools in Wales opt for teaching online a week to deal with rising energy costs,"The Powys Councillor, Beverley Baynaham recently raised the issue of considering all the possible options for savings in the schools of Powys, Wales in the UK. The council said it is focussing on the issue of cutting costs and saving energy and looking for solutions in this direction. The ideas were raised at the council meeting which was held to brief the head teachers and chair of governors at Powys.The officers suggested the council shift to online teaching once a week to deal with the rising energy costs. They suggested that some schools in Wales can choose to conduct weekly online classes to achieve potential savings.Councillor Pete Roberts , the minister responsible for education said that blended weeks of learning can also be considered in extreme cases. Furthermore, it was suggested to have a four-day week with the fifth day being taught virtually at home. However, no clear directive would be given to the schools to do this.l according to the council cabinet member. A financial toolkit has also been prepared and shared with schools to help headteachers and school governors to tackle financial issues. Roberts further informed that the council has been helping the schools by carrying out finance surgeries and scrutinising the budgets for looking at spending patterns and giving suggestions for potential solutions.Besides online classes, the officers suggested that the vacant positions for the school's teachers in Powys should be filled and shifted temporarily to the existing staff members. The other suggestions included finding volunteers to work in schools. The decision to implement either of these suggestions or not will solely rest upon the headteacher and their chair of governors. Roberts said that there cannot be a single solution for the schools so they will decide which option is most viable for their school budget.","The Powys Councillor, Beverley Baynaham recently raised the issue of considering all the possible options for savings in the schools of Powys, Wales in the UK.
